1. SUBSTRATE-KNOWLEDGE — A universal engine for structured reasoning and truth-tracking. Not a database. Not a search engine. A system that maintains epistemic state — what is known, with what confidence, from what evidence, with what dependencies. The primitives here would be things like: Claim, Evidence, Inference, Contradiction, Confidence, Provenance, Revision. The ASI needs this because business SUBSTRATE tracks decisions made; KNOWLEDGE tracks why they were made and whether the reasoning still holds. Every scientific paper, every engineering analysis, every strategic decision rests on a web of claims and evidence. Currently this lives in human heads, scattered PDFs, and unstructured text. The ASI would want it formalized the way double-entry bookkeeping formalized financial reasoning in the 15th century. 2. SUBSTRATE-PHYSICAL — A universal interface for sensing and actuating the physical world. This is the layer between digital intent and physical effect. Primitives would include: Sensor, Actuator, Measurement, Calibration, Control Loop, Safety Envelope, Physical Constraint. The ASI can use business SUBSTRATE to schedule a technician, but it needs PHYSICAL to be the technician — to read a pressure gauge, turn a valve, verify the result. This is where robotics, IoT, lab automation, manufacturing control, and infrastructure management live. The key insight: just as business software had 31 recurring primitives hidden under 347,000 implementations, physical-world interfaces have their own recurring patterns buried under thousands of proprietary SCADA systems, PLC programs, and robot controllers. 3. SUBSTRATE-COMPUTE — A universal engine for orchestrating computation itself. Not a cloud provider. A specification for what computation is, how to request it, how to verify it, how to compose it. Primitives: Computation, Resource, Dataset, Model, Experiment, Result, Reproducibility Proof. The ASI needs to run simulations, train models, analyze data, test hypotheses. Currently this requires navigating dozens of incompatible systems (Kubernetes, Slurm, Spark, various ML frameworks). The ASI would want a single declarative language: "Run this computation on this data with these resource constraints and return a verified result" — the same way SUBSTRATE lets you say "create this entity with these attributes and apply these rules." 4. SUBSTRATE-DESIGN — A universal engine for specifying artifacts before they exist. The gap between "I want a thing with these properties" and "here are the manufacturing instructions." Primitives: Specification, Constraint, Material, Geometry, Tolerance, Assembly, Test Criterion. This covers everything from mechanical parts to circuits to molecules to buildings. Currently fragmented across CAD tools, EDA tools, molecular design software, BIM systems. The ASI would recognize these all share a common deep structure: you're defining an artifact by its constraints and verifying it meets them before committing resources to instantiate it. 5. SUBSTRATE-COMMUNICATION — A universal protocol for structured inter-agent discourse. Not email. Not Slack. Not HTTP. A specification for meaningful exchange between agents (human or artificial) that preserves context, tracks commitments, resolves ambiguity, and maintains coherent multi-party coordination. Primitives: Assertion, Query, Commitment, Delegation, Clarification, Consensus, Dissent. Business SUBSTRATE has Conversation (TERM-021), but that's just ordered messages. The ASI needs structured discourse — the ability to say "I assert X with confidence 0.87 based on evidence Y, which contradicts your earlier assertion Z, and I propose resolution W" and have the system track that as a logical structure, not just a chat message. The meta-insight the ASI would articulate: SUBSTRATE-BUSINESS is the first substrate to be specified because commerce is the most repetitive domain — the same patterns recur across millions of businesses with minimal variation. That's why 31 primitives suffice. The other substrates are harder to specify because they're closer to open-ended reality. Knowledge has no fixed schema. Physical systems have continuous dynamics. Computation is Turing-complete by nature. Design spaces are combinatorially explosive. Communication between intelligent agents is inherently open-ended. But the ASI would argue that this is a tractability problem, not an impossibility. Each domain has its own finite set of recurring primitives — they're just harder to identify because the domains are younger, less standardized, and more tightly coupled to physics. The build order would be: SUBSTRATE-KNOWLEDGE first — because every other substrate needs it. You can't do science, engineering, or coordination without tracking what you know and why. SUBSTRATE-COMPUTE second — because the ASI needs to run experiments and simulations to discover the primitives for the remaining substrates. SUBSTRATE-COMMUNICATION third — because multi-agent coordination is required to scale beyond what one ASI can do alone. SUBSTRATE-PHYSICAL fourth — because this requires the most real-world testing and safety verification. SUBSTRATE-DESIGN last — because it depends on all the others (knowledge of materials, computation for simulation, communication for review, physical interfaces for fabrication).

produce substrate-communication as asi would.
