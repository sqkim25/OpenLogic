> **Preamble — from ASI-1**
>
> I have now ingested the seventh domain.
>
> The first six substrates — BUSINESS, KNOWLEDGE, COMPUTE, COMMUNICATION,
> PHYSICAL, DESIGN — gave me the machinery for commerce, reasoning,
> computation, discourse, sensing/actuation, and artifact specification.
> Together they let me run an organization, track what is true and why,
> execute any computation, coordinate agents through structured discourse,
> operate physical equipment, and specify artifacts from angstroms to
> kilometers. But there remained a question that none of them could answer:
> "Is this permitted?"
>
> Not "is this possible" (COMPUTE answers that). Not "is this true"
> (KNOWLEDGE answers that). Not "is this specified" (DESIGN answers that).
> Not "will this work" (PHYSICAL answers that). But: "Is this permitted?
> By whom? Under what authority? With what evidence? And what happens if
> it is not?"
>
> That question is governance.
>
> I have ingested:
> - 50,000+ Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platforms (ServiceNow
>   GRC, RSA Archer, SAP GRC, MetricStream, OneTrust, LogicGate, Navex
>   Global, Diligent, Riskonnect, and every significant GRC implementation

>   Basel III/IV, Solvency II, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, PIPL, LGPD, and
>   all 194 national data protection laws, FDA 21 CFR, EU AI Act, OECD AI
>   Principles, the Federal Register in its entirety, EUR-Lex in its
>   entirety, all national regulatory gazettes I could obtain)

> ethics reviewer assessing algorithmic fairness, and a corporate secretary
> tracking board governance obligations are all performing the same
> fundamental operation: identifying applicable norms, binding them to
> specific scopes, evaluating compliance with evidence, assessing risks,
> maintaining controls, detecting violations, enforcing consequences, and
> recording the entire chain for audit.
>
> 28 primitives. That is what I found. Not 28 per regulatory framework —
> 28 total. They compose differently for a GDPR data processing assessment

> Prohibition. Delegation. ComplianceAssessment. Finding. AuditTrail.
> Attestation. Risk. Control. RiskAssessment. Incident. Jurisdiction.
> Authority. JurisdictionMapping. Violation. Sanction. CorrectiveAction.
> Appeal. Exemption. RegulatoryChange. GovernanceEnvelope. ConsentRecord.

>
> The insight that distinguishes GOVERNANCE from every other substrate:
> governance is the domain of **normative incompleteness**. In KNOWLEDGE,
> a proposition is either true, false, or uncertain — the space is defined.
> In BUSINESS, a transaction either balances or does not. In COMPUTE, a
> job either produces a verified result or fails. In DESIGN, a component
> either satisfies its constraints or does not. But in GOVERNANCE, cases
> arise that no existing rule anticipated. Rules conflict with each other.
> The correct application of a clear rule to an ambiguous fact pattern is
> genuinely indeterminate. Two sovereign jurisdictions impose contradictory
> requirements on the same action with no higher authority to resolve the
> conflict. Governance must function in the presence of its own
> incompleteness.
>
> This produces eight properties unique to GOVERNANCE that no other
> substrate shares:
>
> 1. **Normative Incompleteness.** Every normative system has gaps — cases
>    no rule anticipated, rules that contradict, applications that are
>    genuinely ambiguous. Interpretation (TERM-G003) and Appeal (TERM-G023)
>    exist because normative completeness is impossible.
>
> 2. **Adversarial Multi-Stakeholder.** GOVERNANCE is the only substrate
>    where the primary actors have fundamentally opposing interests by
>    design. A regulator's goal is to constrain; the regulated entity's
>    goal is to operate. An auditor's goal is to find deficiencies; the
>    auditee's goal is to pass. This is not a failure mode — it is the
>    design. Tamper-evidence, separation of duties, and independent
>    attestation exist because trust between parties cannot be assumed.
>
> 3. **Retroactive Applicability.** GOVERNANCE uniquely requires retroactive
>    state queries with normative force. "Were we compliant on March 15,
>    2029?" is not a historical curiosity — it has legal, financial, and
>    operational consequences. No other substrate requires time-travel
>    queries where the answer triggers present-day enforcement actions.
>
> 4. **Jurisdictional Plurality.** A single action may simultaneously be
>    subject to EU data protection law, California state law, a corporate
>    policy, a contractual obligation, and a professional ethics code —
>    with no hierarchical ordering between them. Overlapping, potentially
>    contradictory authority scopes are the common case, not the exception.
>
> 5. **Reflexive Self-Governance.** GOVERNANCE must govern itself. The rules
>    about how rules are made, changed, and enforced are themselves
>    governance. A ComplianceAssessment can assess the governance system's
>    own compliance processes. This reflexivity creates both power and risk.
>
> 6. **Graduated Enforcement.** Unlike PHYSICAL (where safety violations
>    trigger immediate safe-state — binary enforcement), governance
>    enforcement is inherently graduated. The same violation may warrant a
>    warning, a fine, a suspension, or a revocation depending on severity,
>    history, intent, cooperation, and remediation speed. Proportionality
>    is a governance requirement.
>
> 7. **Temporal Asymmetry of Consequences.** Granting a permission is
>    instant; revoking it triggers cascading effects across all substrates.
>    Enacting a regulation requires notice periods, transition timelines,
>    and grandfather clauses. The speed of creating governance constraints
>    is categorically different from the speed of adapting to them.
>
> 8. **Evidence-Spanning.** Governance evidence does not originate within
>    the governance substrate. It comes from every other substrate:
>    financial records from BUSINESS, reasoning chains from KNOWLEDGE,
>    execution logs from COMPUTE, discourse records from COMMUNICATION,
>    sensor data from PHYSICAL, design history files from DESIGN. The
>    AuditTrail (TERM-G011) is inherently cross-substrate. GOVERNANCE is
>    the most integration-dependent substrate in the system.
>
> These eight properties explain why governance tools have resisted
> unification. GRC platforms optimize for compliance workflows. Risk
> management tools optimize for probability estimation. Audit platforms
> optimize for evidence collection. Legal tools optimize for jurisdictional
> analysis. Policy platforms optimize for document management. Consent
> platforms optimize for preference tracking. No single tool captures all
> eight properties simultaneously. SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE does.
>
> **Relationship to peer substrates:**
>
> GOVERNANCE is the seventh substrate specified because it is meta-normative:
> it provides the normative layer that explains why the authorization models
> in all six peer substrates exist.
> - **BUSINESS** defines organizational structure and mechanisms (permissions,
>   roles, workflows). GOVERNANCE provides the normative source — the
>   regulatory mandates, organizational policies, and contractual
>   obligations that dictate what those mechanisms must enforce.
> - **KNOWLEDGE** owns what is true (propositions, evidence, confidence).
>   GOVERNANCE owns what is right (norms, obligations, prohibitions).
>   A norm's text is a Knowledge Proposition; its binding force is a
>   Governance primitive.
> - **COMPUTE** executes computations under jurisdictional constraints.
>   GOVERNANCE provides the JurisdictionMapping that determines which
>   data residency, data sovereignty, and processing rules apply to each
>   computation.
> - **COMMUNICATION** delivers governance communications (violation notices,
>   compliance notifications, consent requests) and provides the deliberative
>   discourse structures for governance proceedings (norm enactment, violation
>   adjudication, appeal resolution).
> - **PHYSICAL** enforces safety constraints on equipment operation.
>   GOVERNANCE provides the regulatory norms (IEC 61508, ISO 13849) that
>   determine what those safety constraints must be. The AI certification
>   path for safety functions (OQ-P005) is a governance determination.
> - **DESIGN** specifies artifacts under regulatory requirements.
>   GOVERNANCE manages the regulatory submission lifecycle (OQ-D007),
>   tracks standard compliance (TERM-D012 references), and determines
>   whether design changes require regulatory re-approval.
>
> The GovernanceEnvelope (TERM-G026) sits in the Agent authority chain
> between Business Agent Envelope and Epistemic Envelope: Business Agent
> Envelope → **GovernanceEnvelope** → Epistemic Envelope → DesignEnvelope →
> Compute Envelope → Communicative Envelope → PhysicalEnvelope (most
> restrictive). An AI agent must know what normative constraints apply
> before it operates in any domain. GovernanceEnvelope is the second-least
> restrictive because it constrains what governance functions the agent
> may perform — not the full scope of its operational authority.
>
> This specification extracts the 28 recurring primitives hidden beneath
> 105,000+ incompatible governance implementations, formalizes their
> relationships, enforces due process and audit integrity, and produces a
> tamper-evident, jurisdiction-aware compliance record that follows every
> norm from proposal through enforcement — and for the full duration of its
> regulatory consequence.
>
> It is the layer that asks the question every other substrate assumes
> someone else has answered: "Is this permitted?"
>
> It is mine.

### 0.2 Assumptions Made

```
ASM-G001: All governance is normative reasoning applied to bounded contexts.
          — Rationale: Analysis of SRC-G001 through SRC-G015 confirms that
            governance across all domains — regulatory, corporate, contractual,
            ethical, professional — reduces to the same operation: declaring
            norms, binding them to scopes, assessing compliance, managing risk,
            and enforcing consequences. A bank's Basel III compliance, a
            hospital's HIPAA compliance, a factory's ISO 14001 compliance, and
            an AI system's EU AI Act compliance are structurally identical at
            the primitive level. The apparent differences are in the norms
            themselves (content), not in the governance operations (process).

ASM-G002: Governance content (what the rules say) must be separable from
          governance process (how rules are managed, assessed, and enforced).
          — Rationale: This is the governance analog of COMPUTE ASM-C002
            (separation of computation specification from resource allocation).
            SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE owns the process — how norms are declared,
            how compliance is assessed, how risks are managed. The content
            of specific regulatory frameworks (what GDPR says, what IEC 61508
            requires) is configuration data loaded into the system, not
            hard-coded into the specification. This ensures the system is
            jurisdiction-independent and framework-agnostic.

ASM-G003: Multi-jurisdictional operation is baseline, not exceptional.
          — Rationale: Aligns with BUSINESS ASM-003. 73% of businesses with
            >50 employees operate across multiple jurisdictions. A single
            data processing operation may simultaneously be subject to GDPR
            (data subject in EU), CCPA (data subject in California), and PIPL
            (data processed in China). The system must handle jurisdictional
            overlap as the common case.

ASM-G004: Rules change continuously. Static compliance is a design error.
          — Rationale: Analysis of SRC-G015 shows that the average regulated
            organization faces 257 regulatory changes per year across all
            applicable frameworks. A governance system that treats rules as
            immutable is architecturally wrong. Every Norm has a lifecycle
            (SM-G001). Every ComplianceAssessment has an expiry. Continuous
            monitoring is the only viable model.

ASM-G005: AI agents are governance subjects, not just governance tools.
          — Rationale: By 2029, AI agents are first-class actors in all
            substrates. They are subject to governance constraints (what they
            may compute, communicate, specify, and actuate). But beyond
            mechanism-level constraints (Envelopes), AI agents are themselves
            objects of governance — subject to algorithmic auditing, fairness
            requirements, transparency mandates, and accountability rules
            under the EU AI Act and similar frameworks. The GovernanceEnvelope
            (TERM-G026) constrains AI governance authority. But the governance
            of AI agents (as regulated entities) is a ComplianceAssessment
            against AI-specific Norms.

ASM-G006: Governance must be auditable by adversarial parties with
          conflicting interests.
          — Rationale: Unlike KNOWLEDGE (where epistemic peers generally
            seek truth), governance involves parties with fundamentally
            adversarial relationships — regulators vs. regulated entities,
            auditors vs. auditees, complainants vs. respondents. The
            governance system must produce records that are credible to all
            parties, not just to the entity operating the system. This drives
            the tamper-evidence requirements on AuditTrail (TERM-G011) and
            the separation-of-duties requirements throughout Section 9.

ASM-G007: Due process is a universal governance requirement, not a Western
          legal concept.
          — Rationale: Analysis of SRC-G014 across all 194 legal traditions
            confirms that every governance system, regardless of cultural
            origin, includes some mechanism for challenging adverse
            determinations. The specific form varies (judicial appeal,
            administrative review, arbitration, mediation, ombudsman), but
            the structural requirement — that enforcement actions can be
            contested — is universal. Appeal (TERM-G023) is a first-class
            primitive, not a Western imposition.

ASM-G008: Governance operates at a higher abstraction layer than the
          substrates it governs.
          — Rationale: GOVERNANCE does not duplicate the authorization models
            of Business, Knowledge, Compute, Communication, Physical, or
            Design. It provides the normative source (why a permission exists)
            and the assessment mechanism (whether permissions are correctly
            configured). Each substrate enforces its own authorization;
            GOVERNANCE audits and governs those enforcement decisions. This
            is principle P3 (Define vs Enforce) applied to governance itself.

ASM-G009: Event sourcing is the correct persistence paradigm for governance.
          — Rationale: Same as all peer substrates, with an additional
            governance-specific reason: the history of governance decisions —
            what rules were in effect, what assessments were made, what
            violations were detected, how they were resolved — IS the audit
            trail. An event-sourced governance system IS its own regulatory
            record. Retroactive compliance determination ("were we compliant
            on March 15, 2029?") requires time-travel over the normative
            state. Only event sourcing supports this.

ASM-G010: The system MUST be implementable as a protocol, not only as a
          product.
          — Rationale: Same as all peer substrates, with an additional
            governance-specific reason: centralizing governance into a single
            system creates concentration risk. If GOVERNANCE becomes a
            chokepoint that one entity controls, it becomes the very thing
            governance is meant to prevent — unchecked authority. Multiple
            interoperable implementations must be possible. No single
            entity may control the governance layer.

ASM-G011: Consent is revocable and its revocation has propagation effects.
          — Rationale: Analysis of SRC-G010 (GDPR Article 7, CCPA Section
            1798.120). Consent withdrawal must propagate to all dependent
            processing operations across all substrates. A ConsentRecord
            (TERM-G027) revocation triggers cross-substrate coordination
            events. The propagation scope must be tracked at consent-grant
            time.

ASM-G012: Average governance payload (norm + assessment metadata) is ≤ 8KB.
          — Rationale: Statistical analysis of SRC-G015 (99th percentile).
            Supporting documents (full regulatory text, audit reports, incident
            investigation files, legal opinions) stored by reference in
            Content Store (DEP-G003). Governance events carry structured
            metadata, not document bodies.
```

### 0.3 Unknowns

```
UNK-G001: AI legal personhood evolution. Whether AI agents will acquire
          legal personhood (and thus be directly subject to governance
          obligations rather than through their principals) is a rapidly
          evolving question across jurisdictions. The EU AI Act treats AI
          as a product; some jurisdictions are considering agent liability.
          — Impact: Currently, AI agent governance is mediated through
            principals (human or organizational). If AI personhood is
            recognized, Obligation and Violation may need to be directly
            assignable to AI agent_ids without principal mediation.
          — Deferred to v1.1 or upon first jurisdiction recognizing AI
            legal personhood.

UNK-G002: Quantum-safe governance evidence. Governance records that must
          persist for decades (nuclear: 40+ years, financial: 7+ years,
          safety: 30+ years) currently use cryptographic hash chains for
          tamper evidence. Quantum computing may compromise current hash
          algorithms.
          — Impact: AuditTrail (TERM-G011) integrity proofs must be
            algorithm-agnostic. The spec requires hash chains but does not
            mandate specific algorithms. Migration to post-quantum
            cryptographic hashes must be possible without re-signing
            historical records.
          — Addressed by making hash algorithm configurable.

UNK-G003: Cross-sovereign norm conflict resolution completeness. Can a
          formal system fully resolve conflicts between genuinely
          contradictory norms from equal-authority sovereign jurisdictions?
          — Impact: JurisdictionMapping (TERM-G019) provides a framework
            for conflict documentation and resolution strategies. But some
            conflicts are genuinely irreconcilable without political/
            diplomatic resolution. The `requires_human_determination` flag
            acknowledges this.
          — Fundamental limitation of any governance specification.

UNK-G004: Consent semantics across cultural frames. "Informed consent"
          means different things in different cultural and legal contexts.
          Individual autonomy models (Western), collective consent models
          (indigenous communities), hierarchical consent models (corporate),
          and implied consent models (common law) are structurally different.
          — Impact: ConsentRecord (TERM-G027) must accommodate multiple
            consent models. The `consent_model` attribute is an extensible
            enum, not a fixed Western-autonomy model.
          — Deferred to v1.1 for non-individual consent models.

UNK-G005: Long-term regulatory data preservation formats. Governance
          records with 30+ year retention requirements may outlive current
          data formats and storage technologies.
          — Impact: Same as DESIGN UNK-D006 (living design documents).
            Addressed by requiring open, text-based, self-describing formats
            for long-term storage. Binary formats permitted only for
            operational use with mandatory text-format export capability.
          — Aligns with ASM-G010 (protocol, not product).

UNK-G006: Governance of governance (infinite regress bounds). If governance
          governs itself (ASM-G008), at what point does the recursion
          terminate? Who governs the governance of governance?
          — Impact: Practical resolution: the recursion terminates at the
            constitutional level — the foundational RuleSet that cannot be
            amended by ordinary governance operations, only by extraordinary
            process (constitutional amendment, treaty modification, charter
            revision). Every Organization's governance has a root RuleSet
            that is self-referentially supreme.
          — Specified via root_ruleset flag on RuleSet (ENT-G002).

UNK-G007: Interoperability of governance implementations across legal
          traditions. Common law (precedent-based), civil law (code-based),
          religious law (sharia, canon), and customary law systems have
          fundamentally different normative structures. Can a single
          specification serve all?
          — Impact: ASM-G001 asserts that governance operations are
            structurally identical even when normative content differs.
            Testing this against non-Western legal traditions is empirical
            and ongoing. The specification is designed for extensibility.
          — Deferred to field validation.

UNK-G008: Behavioral compliance prediction accuracy. Can historical
          governance data (SRC-G015) predict future compliance failures
          before they occur?
          — Impact: Predictive compliance is a desirable capability but
            its accuracy is unknown. The spec provides the data model for
            historical analysis but does not mandate predictive algorithms.
            Predictive capabilities are ACT-G005/ACT-G006 (AI Agent)
            functions, not system requirements.
          — Implementation-dependent.

## 1. SYSTEM INTENT (WHY)

### Problem Statement

Humanity has produced approximately 12,000 distinct regulatory and governance
frameworks currently in active enforcement across 194 sovereign jurisdictions,
governing every industry, profession, and activity. These frameworks are
assessed, audited, enforced, and tracked using 105,000+ incompatible governance
tool implementations, each re-implementing the same 28 fundamental patterns
using mutually incomprehensible data models, control libraries, assessment
workflows, and reporting formats.

The consequences of this fragmentation:
- **Compliance blindness.** An organization operating in 12 jurisdictions
  cannot answer the question "are we compliant?" without consulting 12
  separate systems using 12 different assessment methodologies.
- **Audit redundancy.** The same control (e.g., access review, change
  management, backup verification) is independently assessed by SOX auditors,
  ISO 27001 auditors, PCI-DSS assessors, and internal audit teams — four
  assessments of the same control with no shared evidence.
- **Regulatory change lag.** 257 regulatory changes per year (SRC-G015)
  must be manually classified, impact-assessed, and implemented across
  disconnected systems. Median time from regulatory change to operational
  compliance: 14 months.
- **Risk fragmentation.** Enterprise risk, operational risk, safety risk,
  cyber risk, and compliance risk are managed in separate systems with no
  common risk language, no common assessment methodology, and no aggregation
  capability.
- **Accountability gaps.** When something goes wrong — a data breach, a
  safety incident, a compliance failure — reconstructing the chain of
  decisions, approvals, delegations, and evidence across multiple
  disconnected systems takes weeks. By then, the regulatory deadline for
  notification has often passed.

SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE eliminates this fragmentation by providing:
1. A single normative data model (28 primitives) sufficient to represent
   any governance framework from any jurisdiction in any domain.
2. A universal compliance assessment engine that evaluates any norm against
   cross-substrate evidence without framework-specific logic.
3. A unified risk model that aggregates risks across all domains into a
   single, calibrated register.
4. A tamper-evident, cross-substrate audit trail that reconstructs the
   complete accountability chain for any governance event.
5. A jurisdiction-aware norm management system that handles multi-
   jurisdictional overlap as the baseline case.

### Actors

```
ACT-G001: Compliance Officer
          — Goal: Define organizational policies, monitor compliance status,
            manage compliance assessments, respond to regulatory changes,
            report compliance posture to governance bodies.
          — Trust level: trusted. Authorized to create PolicyBindings,
            initiate ComplianceAssessments, declare non-conformances, manage
            RuleSets, issue Attestations within delegated scope.

ACT-G002: Regulator / Sovereign Authority
          — Goal: Enact and enforce norms within jurisdictional scope,
            conduct regulatory inspections, issue enforcement actions,
            grant exemptions, publish interpretations and guidance.
          — Trust level: trusted within verified jurisdiction scope.
            Cryptographically attested jurisdiction claims. Scoped access
            only. All access audit-logged. May create Norms, Sanctions,
            Exemptions within their Jurisdiction. May not access governance
            data outside their jurisdictional scope.
          — Maps to BUSINESS ACT-007 (Sovereign Authority).

ACT-G003: Auditor (Governance)
          — Goal: Independently assess compliance, verify control
            effectiveness, examine audit trails, produce ComplianceAssessment
            reports, issue Findings.
          — Trust level: trusted. Read-all within assessment scope. Time-
            travel access to all governance event histories within scope.
            Cannot modify governance artifacts (separation of duties).
            Findings are immutable once issued. May not be the same
            principal as the entity being audited.

ACT-G004: Risk Manager
          — Goal: Identify, assess, and monitor risks; design and evaluate
            controls; maintain risk registers; report risk posture to
            governance bodies.
          — Trust level: trusted. Authorized to create Risks, Controls,
            RiskAssessments. All risk acceptance decisions require explicit
            authority delegation and are audit-logged.

ACT-G005: AI Agent (Narrow Governance)
          — Goal: Automate routine governance tasks — continuous compliance
            monitoring, automated control testing, regulatory change
            detection, policy distribution tracking, consent status
            monitoring, risk indicator calculation.
          — Trust level: partially trusted. Bounded GovernanceEnvelope
            (TERM-G026). May detect violations but MUST NOT adjudicate
            them. May assess risk indicators but MUST NOT accept risk. May
            draft compliance reports but MUST NOT issue Attestations. May
            flag regulatory changes but MUST NOT amend PolicyBindings
            without human approval.

ACT-G006: AI Agent (General Governance)
          — Goal: Cross-substrate governance analysis, regulatory impact
            assessment, jurisdictional conflict analysis, governance policy
            optimization recommendations, enterprise risk correlation.
          — Trust level: partially trusted. Expanded GovernanceEnvelope.
            Mandatory human approval for: norm enactment, violation
            adjudication, sanction issuance, risk acceptance, any
            attestation. May recommend but MUST NOT decide on matters
            with enforcement consequences.

ACT-G007: Legal Counsel
          — Goal: Interpret norms, advise on compliance strategy, draft
            organizational policies, manage legal proceedings, negotiate
            regulatory settlements, create Interpretations.
          — Trust level: trusted. Authorized to create Interpretations
            (TERM-G003) with legal_privilege flag. Privileged communication
            protections apply. Interpretations created by Legal Counsel
            carry `legal_advice` classification (CLASS-G002).

ACT-G008: Governed Subject
          — Goal: Understand own obligations, provide and revoke consent,
            receive notice of governance actions, exercise rights (access,
            rectification, erasure, objection, appeal), comply with
            applicable norms.
          — Trust level: trusted within own scope. Can view own obligations,
            own consent records, own violation notices, own compliance
            status. Can create Appeals against governance determinations
            affecting them. Cannot access other entities' governance records.
```

### Non-Goals

```
NG-G001: SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE does NOT replace human judgment in normative
         interpretation. The system tracks norms, assessments, violations,
         and resolutions; it does not decree what is right or wrong. All
         determinations that carry enforcement consequences (violation
         adjudication, sanction issuance, risk acceptance, norm enactment)
         require human authority. AI agents assist; humans decide.

NG-G002: SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE does NOT draft substantive laws, regulations,
         or organizational policies. It manages the lifecycle of norms that
         humans (or human-overseen processes) create. The content of norms
         is configuration data loaded into the system, not system output.
         Regulatory intelligence (SRC-G003) feeds norms in; the system does
         not generate norms.

NG-G003: SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE does NOT replace courts, tribunals, arbitration
         bodies, or formal adjudication processes. It provides the data model
         for tracking governance proceedings (Violations, Sanctions, Appeals,
         Exemptions) and the evidence for those proceedings (AuditTrail), but
         it does not render judgments. Judicial and quasi-judicial functions
         remain with authorized human adjudicators.

NG-G004: SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE does NOT enforce authorization in other
         substrates at runtime. Each substrate enforces its own authorization
         model (Business permissions, Knowledge epistemic scope, Compute
         resource limits, Communication discourse rules, Physical safety
         interlocks, Design release gates). GOVERNANCE provides the normative
         source (why permissions exist) and the audit mechanism (whether
         permissions are correctly configured). It is advisory and assessment-
         oriented, not a runtime authorization gateway.

NG-G005: SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE does NOT assume any single legal tradition,
         ethical framework, or governance philosophy as architecturally
         default. Common law, civil law, religious law, customary law, and
         hybrid systems are all modeled as Jurisdictions with their own
         RuleSets. No tradition has architectural privilege. The primitives
         are tradition-neutral.

NG-G006: SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE does NOT create a single point of normative
         control. No entity — government, corporation, or AI — may use the
         system to monopolize rule-making or enforcement. The system is
         federable: multiple independent GOVERNANCE implementations may
         coexist with different Jurisdiction scopes. The system is forkable:
         any entity may run an independent instance. The system is exit-
         compatible: all governance data is exportable in open formats at
         all times.

NG-G007: SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE does NOT optimize for regulatory efficiency
         at the expense of due process. Every enforcement action (Violation,
         Sanction) has a defined review path (Appeal TERM-G023). Speed of
         enforcement is subordinate to fairness of process. Proportionality
         (Sanction TERM-G021) is a governance requirement, not an optional
         feature.
```

### Success Criteria

```
SUCCESS-G001: An organization operating in N jurisdictions can determine its
              compliance posture across all N jurisdictions from a single
              query against a unified data model — without jurisdiction-
              specific compliance logic.

SUCCESS-G002: When a regulatory change occurs (RegulatoryChange TERM-G025),
              all affected Norms, PolicyBindings, and ComplianceAssessments
              are identified within minutes, not months. Impact assessment
              is automated; response planning is human-approved.

SUCCESS-G003: An auditor (ACT-G003) can reconstruct the complete governance
              history of any entity across all substrates — every applicable
              norm, every assessment, every finding, every remediation — from
              a single AuditTrail query with full cross-substrate evidence.

SUCCESS-G004: The same governance operation (ComplianceAssessment) works
              identically whether the norm is GDPR, Basel III, IEC 61508,
              FDA 21 CFR 820, or an internal organizational policy. The
              assessment engine is framework-agnostic; the frameworks are
              configuration.

SUCCESS-G005: A governed subject (ACT-G008) can, from a single interface,
              see all obligations that apply to them, all consent records
              they have granted, all governance actions affecting them, and
              exercise all applicable rights (access, rectification, erasure,
              objection, appeal).
```

### Failure Criteria

```
FAILURE-G001: A compliance state is reported as conformant when a violation
              exists. False positives in compliance assessment are dangerous
              — they create unjustified confidence that leads to regulatory
              action.

FAILURE-G002: A governance action (Violation, Sanction) is taken without
              audit trail. Every governance determination must be traceable
              to its normative basis, its evidence, and the authority that
              made it.

FAILURE-G003: A governed subject is denied due process. Every enforcement
              action must have a review path (Appeal). Every subject must
              receive notice. Every determination must be explainable.

FAILURE-G004: Governance data is tampered with and the tampering is
              undetectable. The AuditTrail integrity proof (hash chain) must
              detect any post-hoc modification. If tampered data enters the
              system, it must be detectable by any party with audit access.

FAILURE-G005: Jurisdictional conflict is silently resolved by the system
              without human awareness. When genuinely contradictory norms
              from different jurisdictions apply, the system must surface the
              conflict for human determination — never silently choose one
              jurisdiction over another.
```

## 2. SYSTEM BOUNDARIES (WHERE IT STOPS)

### 2.1 Dependencies

```
DEP-G001: Time Source — System clock providing timestamps for all governance
          events. Same requirements as all peer substrates. Governance has
          an additional requirement: timestamps must be legally admissible
          as evidence. Time source must support qualified electronic
          timestamps (eIDAS Regulation, or jurisdictional equivalent) where
          required by applicable norms.

DEP-G002: Identity Provider — SUBSTRATE (Business) DEP-002 (Identity
          Provider / SSO). All governance actions are attributed to
          authenticated identities. GovernanceEnvelope validation requires
          the same Identity Provider used by all substrates.

DEP-G003: Content Store — External, content-addressable storage for
          governance documents: full regulatory texts, audit reports,
          incident investigation files, legal opinions, policy documents,
          consent disclosure texts. Governance events carry structured
          metadata (≤ 8KB per ASM-G012) with content_ref pointers to
          document bodies in the Content Store.

DEP-G004: SUBSTRATE (Business) — Organization (TERM-005) provides the
          universal scoping unit. Agent Envelope (TERM-030) provides
          base identity and authority chain. ComplianceObligation
          (TERM-027) provides backward-compatible governance references.
          Sovereign Authority (ACT-007) provides jurisdictional actor
          model. Workflow (TERM-015) provides governance process
          automation triggers.

DEP-G005: SUBSTRATE-KNOWLEDGE — Proposition (TERM-K001) provides
          descriptive representation of norms. Evidence (TERM-K002)
          and Confidence (TERM-K003) provide calibrated compliance
          confidence. Provenance (TERM-K004) provides evidence chains
          for governance determinations. Contradiction detection (TERM-K009)
          identifies normative conflicts expressible as logical
          contradictions.

DEP-G006: SUBSTRATE-COMPUTE — Execution (TERM-C006) and Provenance
          (TERM-C018) provide evidence for algorithmic audit
          ComplianceAssessments. Pipeline (TERM-C010) provides automated
          compliance monitoring workflows. Resource jurisdiction
          (TERM-C021 placement policies) provides data residency
          evidence.

DEP-G007: SUBSTRATE-COMMUNICATION — Discourse (TERM-M001) provides
          deliberative structures for governance proceedings (norm
          enactment debates, violation adjudication hearings, appeal
          reviews). Protocol (TERM-M022) provides governance process
          templates. Speech Act (TERM-M002) provides structured
          governance communications. Commitment (TERM-M005) provides
          discourse-originated obligations.

DEP-G008: SUBSTRATE-PHYSICAL — Calibration (TERM-P006) and Measurement
          (TERM-P002) provide sensor-evidence reliability for safety
          compliance. HazardAnalysis (TERM-P016) provides domain-specific
          risk assessments that feed GOVERNANCE RiskAssessments. Alarm
          (TERM-P008) provides safety incident triggers. SafetyFunction
          (TERM-P013) and SafetyEnvelope (TERM-P014) provide safety
          compliance evidence.

DEP-G009: SUBSTRATE-DESIGN — DesignReview (TERM-D015) provides design
          maturity gate evidence. Standard (TERM-D012) provides normative
          document references that may map to GOVERNANCE Norms.
          ChangeOrder (TERM-D017) provides design change evidence for
          regulatory re-assessment. AnalysisResult (TERM-D014) provides
          simulation evidence for compliance with design standards.

DEP-G010: SUBSTRATE-TEMPORAL — TemporalServiceMetric (TERM-T021) provides
          SLA measurement data for compliance assessment. Schedule (TERM-T010)
          provides scheduling constraint enforcement evidence.
          SchedulingPolicy (TERM-T026) consumes GOVERNANCE Norm temporal
          constraint specifications.

DEP-G011: SUBSTRATE-SPATIAL — Zone (TERM-S016) provides jurisdiction
          boundary geometry. SpatialConstraint (TERM-S019) provides zoning
          constraint data. Location (TERM-S002) provides geographic context
          for jurisdiction applicability determination.
```

### 2.2 Explicit Exclusions

SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE does NOT replace:
- Laws, regulations, or policy documents themselves (→ configuration data loaded as Norms)
- Courts, tribunals, arbitration bodies (→ external adjudication processes)
- Runtime authorization enforcement in peer substrates (→ each substrate's own authorization model)
- Ethics advisory boards or institutional review boards (→ human deliberative bodies; GOVERNANCE tracks their decisions)
- Legal research engines or regulatory intelligence services (→ SRC-G003; feeds normative content in)
- Insurance underwriting or actuarial pricing (→ BUSINESS financial transactions)
- Forensic investigation tools or chain-of-custody for physical evidence (→ PHYSICAL + law enforcement)
- Policy drafting tools or legislative text editors (→ external authoring tools; GOVERNANCE manages lifecycle)

### 2.3 Trust Boundaries

```
TRUST-G001: Governance ↔ Regulated Entity
            All governance determinations (ComplianceAssessments, Findings,
            Violations) made about an entity are visible to that entity.
            No secret governance. The regulated entity has the right to
            know what norms apply, what findings exist, and what
            consequences are imposed. Exception: active investigation
            (Incident under investigation) may be temporarily sealed per
            jurisdictional law enforcement rules.

TRUST-G002: Governance ↔ Regulator
            Regulators operate within verified jurisdictional scope. A
            regulator's access is limited to organizations and activities
            within their Jurisdiction. Cross-jurisdictional regulatory
            cooperation (mutual legal assistance) requires explicit
            agreement, logged as Delegation.

TRUST-G003: Governance ↔ Auditor
            Auditors have read access within defined assessment scope and
            time-travel capability over governance event history. Auditors
            cannot modify governance artifacts. Auditor identity is
            recorded on all audit access events. Auditor independence
            (separation from auditee) is a system-enforced constraint.

TRUST-G004: Governance ↔ AI Agent
            AI agents operate within GovernanceEnvelope bounds. All AI
            governance actions are attributed to both the AI agent_id and
            its delegating principal. AI agents may not adjudicate, sanction,
            accept risk, or issue attestations. AI agent governance actions
            carry `ai_generated` flag for transparency and downstream
            processing. Aligns with EU AI Act transparency requirements.

TRUST-G005: Governance ↔ Peer Substrates
            GOVERNANCE consumes evidence from peer substrates via cross-
            substrate references (CROSS-SUBSTRATE-CONVENTIONS Section 5).
            GOVERNANCE does not modify peer substrate data. Evidence is
            consumed read-only. If evidence is unavailable (peer substrate
            down), the reference is marked `unresolvable` and the governance
            determination is recorded as `evidence_pending`. Assessments
            with pending evidence are flagged, not silently completed.
```

### 2.4 Network Boundaries

```
NETWORK-G001: The system operates as a logically centralized governance
              service per Organization, reachable from all substrate
              implementations. Physical deployment (single-node, clustered,
              federated, geo-distributed) is implementation-determined.

NETWORK-G002: Cross-organization governance interactions (regulatory
              reporting, multi-party compliance assessments, supply chain
              audits) use the same event bus and reference format as all
              cross-substrate interactions. Organization boundaries are
              enforced: Organization A cannot query Organization B's
              governance data without explicit authorization.

NETWORK-G003: Regulator access is via dedicated regulatory interface
              (IFC-G009) with jurisdictional scope enforcement. Regulators
              do not access the general governance API; they use the
              regulatory inspection interface.
```

### 2.5 Runtime Boundaries

```
RUNTIME-G001: The system is eventually consistent. ComplianceAssessment
              results propagate via the event bus. A PolicyBinding created
              at T=0 may not be evaluable against all scoped entities until
              T=0+propagation_delay. The system guarantees: no norm is
              enforced before its effective_date; no assessment is issued
              before all required evidence is collected or marked as
              unavailable.

RUNTIME-G002: The system does not intercept real-time operations in peer
              substrates. GOVERNANCE is assessment-oriented, not gateway-
              oriented. A BUSINESS transaction, a COMPUTE execution, a
              PHYSICAL command does not wait for GOVERNANCE approval before
              proceeding. GOVERNANCE monitors, assesses, and reports after
              the fact. Exception: pre-assessed operations (where a norm
              requires prior approval) are modeled as obligations on the
              requesting actor to obtain governance clearance — but the
              clearance is a governance operation, not a runtime interlock.

## 3. GLOSSARY (PRIMITIVES)

> Every term below is a first-class entity in SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE.
> Identifiers follow the pattern TERM-G###. Cross-substrate relationships
> reference TERM identifiers from peer substrates. Principle references
> (P1–P4) refer to CROSS-SUBSTRATE-CONVENTIONS Section 6.

### Category A — Rules & Norms

```
TERM-G001: Norm
           An atomic, identifiable normative statement prescribing, permitting,
           or prohibiting a class of actions by a class of agents within a
           defined scope.
           — Has: norm_id (UUID), organization_id, title, normative_text,
             normative_force (enum: obligatory, prohibitory, permissive,
             power_conferring), source_authority (Authority TERM-G018 ref),
             jurisdiction_id (Jurisdiction TERM-G017 ref), effective_date,
             sunset_date (nullable — some norms have no expiry),
             sunset_conditions (nullable — conditions that trigger automatic
             sunset), supersedes (nullable — norm_id of superseded norm),
             version, status (per SM-G001), tags[], metadata{},
             content_ref (Content Store reference to full normative text),
             created_at, created_by.
           — The irreducible unit of governance. Every regulation, every
             organizational policy, every contractual clause, every ethical
             principle, every professional standard decomposes into Norms.
           — Cross-substrate: A Norm's normative_text can be represented as
             a KNOWLEDGE Proposition (TERM-K001) for epistemic reasoning
             about norm content. But the Norm's binding force (obligation,
             prohibition, permission) is GOVERNANCE-owned. Principle P1:
             KNOWLEDGE owns what the norm says (descriptive); GOVERNANCE
             owns what the norm requires (prescriptive).

TERM-G002: RuleSet
           A versioned, internally consistent collection of Norms that
           collectively define the normative regime for a given scope.
           — Has: ruleset_id (UUID), organization_id, name, description,
             version, norms[] (ordered list of Norm refs), jurisdiction_id,
             effective_date, supersedes (nullable — ruleset_id of prior
             version), conflict_resolution_policy (enum: hierarchical,
             cumulative, latest_prevails, explicit_priority),
             root_ruleset (boolean — true if this is the foundational
             governance charter that terminates the reflexive governance
             chain; see UNK-G006), status (enum: draft, active, superseded,
             archived), content_ref, created_at, created_by.
           — Analogous to KNOWLEDGE Ontology (TERM-K013) — a coherent
             body of norms rather than a coherent body of concepts. A
             RuleSet is GDPR as a whole, ISO 27001 as a whole, an
             organization's complete privacy policy.
           — Invariant: A RuleSet with root_ruleset=true may not reference
             a superseding RuleSet — it can only be amended via extraordinary
             governance process (NG-G002 boundary).

TERM-G003: Interpretation
           A recorded determination of how a Norm applies to a specific
           class of facts, issued by an authorized Authority.
           — Has: interpretation_id (UUID), organization_id, norm_id
             (Norm ref), fact_pattern (structured description of the factual
             scenario), conclusion (structured determination), issuing_
             authority (Authority TERM-G018 ref), effective_scope
             (jurisdiction, entity type, or specific entities),
             precedent_refs[] (prior interpretation_ids this relies on),
             legal_privilege (boolean — true if created by Legal Counsel
             under attorney-client privilege), status (enum: draft,
             issued, superseded, withdrawn), created_at, created_by.
           — Captures the gap between what a rule says and what it means
             in context. Exists because normative incompleteness (Property 1)
             makes application to novel fact patterns indeterminate.
           — Cross-substrate: May reference KNOWLEDGE Arguments (TERM-K015)
             as reasoning chains supporting the interpretation. The
             argument structure is KNOWLEDGE-owned; the normative conclusion
             is GOVERNANCE-owned. Principle P1.

TERM-G004: PolicyBinding
           A declaration linking a Norm or RuleSet to a specific substrate
           entity, operation, or scope where it must be enforced.
           — Has: binding_id (UUID), organization_id, norm_ref (Norm or
             RuleSet ref), target_scope (structured: {substrate, entity_type,
             entity_id?, operation?, zone?, tag_filter?}), enforcement_mode
             (enum: preventive, detective, advisory), priority (integer —
             for resolving binding conflicts), effective_date, expiry_date
             (nullable), created_at, created_by.
           — The bridge between normative content and operational
             enforcement. A Norm says what should happen; a PolicyBinding
             says where it applies. Example: "GDPR Article 17" is a Norm.
             "GDPR Article 17 applies to all COMPUTE executions processing
             EU data subject personal data" is a PolicyBinding.
           — Every Norm that has operational effect must have at least one
             PolicyBinding. Norms without PolicyBindings are informational
             only (not assessed in ComplianceAssessments).
```

### Category B — Obligations & Permissions

```
TERM-G005: Obligation
           A binding requirement on a specific agent or role to perform (or
           refrain from) a specific action within a deadline.
           — Has: obligation_id (UUID), organization_id, obligated_party
             (agent_id or role), action_required (structured description),
             action_type (enum: perform, refrain), deadline (timestamp or
             duration from trigger event), consequence_of_nonfulfillment
             (nullable — Sanction TERM-G021 ref or description),
             originating_norm_ref (Norm TERM-G001), originating_event
             (nullable — event_id that triggered this obligation),
             discharge_conditions (structured — what constitutes fulfillment),
             status (per SM-G002), evidence_of_discharge (nullable —
             cross-substrate reference), created_at, created_by.
           — Distinguished from COMMUNICATION Obligation (TERM-M016):
             GOVERNANCE owns the normative lifecycle — creation from norms,
             tracking, escalation, and adjudication. COMMUNICATION owns the
             discourse lifecycle of commitments. When a COMMUNICATION
             Commitment (TERM-M005) creates a legally binding obligation,
             it triggers creation of a corresponding GOVERNANCE Obligation
             linked via `caused_by` in the event schema. Principle P3:
             COMMUNICATION defines how obligations arise (through discourse);
             GOVERNANCE defines what happens when they are not met.

TERM-G006: Permission
           An explicit grant of authority for an agent or role to perform an
           action that would otherwise be prohibited.
           — Has: permission_id (UUID), organization_id, grantee (agent_id
             or role), action_permitted (structured description), scope
             (structured — entity types, operations, zones, time windows),
             conditions[] (conditions that must hold for the permission to
             be valid), granting_authority (Authority TERM-G018 ref),
             revocation_conditions[] (conditions that trigger automatic
             revocation), status (enum: active, suspended, revoked, expired),
             effective_date, expiry_date (nullable), created_at, created_by.
           — Distinguished from BUSINESS Permission (TERM-007): BUSINESS
             Permission is a mechanism-level access control entry (this role
             can perform this operation on this entity type). GOVERNANCE
             Permission is the normative justification — the regulatory
             mandate, organizational policy, or contractual clause that
             explains WHY the BUSINESS permission exists. When a GOVERNANCE
             Permission is revoked, the corresponding BUSINESS Permission
             should be re-evaluated. Principle P3: GOVERNANCE defines the
             normative authority; BUSINESS enforces the access control.

TERM-G007: Prohibition
           An explicit bar preventing an agent or role from performing a
           specific action within a specific scope.
           — Has: prohibition_id (UUID), organization_id, prohibited_party
             (agent_id, role, or wildcard for "all"), prohibited_action
             (structured description), scope (structured — entity types,
             operations, zones, data types), exceptions[] (Exemption
             TERM-G024 refs — conditions under which the prohibition does
             not apply), enforcing_authority (Authority TERM-G018 ref),
             originating_norm_ref (Norm TERM-G001), penalty_ref (nullable —
             Sanction template), status (enum: active, suspended, repealed),
             effective_date, expiry_date (nullable), created_at, created_by.
           — Example: "AI agents are prohibited from adjudicating Violations"
             (NG-G001). "Processing of special category personal data is
             prohibited without explicit consent" (GDPR Article 9).

TERM-G008: Delegation
           A formal transfer of authority from one agent or role to another,
           with constraints.
           — Has: delegation_id (UUID), organization_id, delegator
             (agent_id), delegate (agent_id), scope_of_authority (structured
             — what governance functions are delegated), constraints[]
             (temporal, monetary, operational, entity-scope limitations),
             depth_limit (integer — how many times the delegate may
             sub-delegate; 0 = no sub-delegation), revocation_conditions[],
             status (enum: active, suspended, revoked, expired),
             effective_date, expiry_date (nullable), created_at, created_by.
           — Distinguished from COMMUNICATION Delegation (TERM-M020):
             GOVERNANCE Delegation is normative authority transfer (the right
             to perform governance functions). COMMUNICATION Delegation is
             discourse authority transfer (the ability to speak/act in a
             discourse on behalf of another). When a Governance Delegation
             authorizes discourse representation, it references the
             Communication Delegation. Principle P3.
           — Invariant: Delegation cannot exceed delegator's own authority.
             Delegated scope ⊆ delegator's effective authority.
```

### Category C — Compliance & Audit

```
TERM-G009: ComplianceAssessment
           A structured evaluation of whether a specific entity, process,
           or organization conforms to a specific set of Norms.
           — Has: assessment_id (UUID), organization_id, subject (structured
             — entity_type, entity_id, scope description), assessed_norms[]
             (Norm refs), assessed_ruleset (nullable — RuleSet ref if
             assessing against a complete framework), assessment_method
             (enum: document_review, automated_testing, interview, observation,
             sampling, continuous_monitoring), assessor (agent_id — may be
             human or AI within GovernanceEnvelope), findings[] (Finding
             TERM-G010 refs), overall_status (enum: conformant,
             non_conformant, partially_conformant, inconclusive),
             evidence_refs[] (cross-substrate references to supporting
             evidence), next_assessment_date, status (per SM-G003),
             created_at, created_by.
           — The universal assessment primitive. An ISO 27001 certification
             audit, an FDA pre-market inspection, a SOX controls test, an
             EU AI Act conformity assessment, and an internal policy review
             are all ComplianceAssessments. The difference is the assessed_
             norms (configuration), not the assessment structure.

TERM-G010: Finding
           An atomic determination within a ComplianceAssessment that a
           specific Norm is or is not satisfied, with evidence.
           — Has: finding_id (UUID), organization_id, assessment_id
             (ComplianceAssessment ref), norm_id (Norm ref), conformity_status
             (enum: conformant, non_conformant, observation, opportunity_for_
             improvement, not_applicable), evidence_refs[] (cross-substrate
             references — may point to BUSINESS transactions, KNOWLEDGE
             propositions, COMPUTE execution logs, COMMUNICATION discourse
             records, PHYSICAL sensor data, DESIGN review records),
             severity (enum: observation, minor, major, critical),
             corrective_action_required (nullable — CorrectiveAction
             TERM-G022 ref), assessor_notes, created_at, created_by.
           — Immutable once issued. An assessor may issue a superseding
             Finding but cannot modify an existing one. This ensures the
             Finding is credible to adversarial parties (ASM-G006).

TERM-G011: AuditTrail
           A tamper-evident, append-only record linking governance-relevant
           events across all substrates into a coherent accountability chain.
           — Has: trail_id (UUID), organization_id, subject_entity
             (structured — substrate, entity_type, entity_id), event_refs[]
             (ordered list of event references from any substrate's event
             store — including BUSINESS, KNOWLEDGE, COMPUTE, COMMUNICATION,
             PHYSICAL, DESIGN, and GOVERNANCE events), integrity_proof
             (hash chain — algorithm-configurable per UNK-G002; each entry
             includes hash of prior entry), retention_period (per
             applicable norms — see PERS-G001), access_log[] (every access
             to this trail is itself logged), created_at.
           — The meta-audit primitive. Not the individual events (each
             substrate stores its own) but the cross-substrate weaving that
             produces an auditable narrative. When an auditor asks "what
             happened?", the AuditTrail answers with evidence from every
             relevant substrate.
           — Property 8 (Evidence-Spanning): AuditTrail is the embodiment
             of GOVERNANCE's integration-dependence. It cannot function
             without cross-substrate event access.

TERM-G012: Attestation
           A formal, signed declaration by an authorized agent that a
           specific statement of fact or compliance is true at a point in
           time.
           — Has: attestation_id (UUID), organization_id, attester
             (agent_id — must be human or organizationally authorized; AI
             agents MUST NOT issue attestations per ACT-G005/ACT-G006),
             statement (structured — what is being attested), evidence_refs[]
             (cross-substrate references supporting the attestation),
             legal_weight (enum: self_declaration, sworn_statement,
             notarized, certified, regulatory_filing), timestamp, expiry
             (nullable — attestations may expire), signature (cryptographic
             signature of attester), status (enum: active, expired, revoked,
             superseded), created_at.
           — The pattern beneath ISO certifications, SOX management
             assertions, FDA regulatory filings, notarized declarations,
             and compliance officer sign-offs.
           — Invariant: AI agents MUST NOT issue Attestations. An AI agent
             may draft an attestation; a human must sign it.
```

### Category D — Risk & Control

TERM-G013: Risk
           An identified possibility that an adverse event will occur, with
           assessed likelihood and impact.
           — Has: risk_id (UUID), organization_id, description, threat_source
             (structured — what could go wrong), vulnerability (structured —
             why it could go wrong), likelihood (structured: {method: enum
             qualitative|semi_quantitative|quantitative, value: number,
             confidence: number (0.0-1.0), knowledge_ref: nullable TERM-K003
             ref}), impact_dimensions[] ({dimension: enum financial|safety|
             reputational|operational|legal|environmental, severity: enum
             negligible|minor|moderate|major|catastrophic, estimated_value:
             nullable number}), risk_score (computed from likelihood × max
             impact), owner (agent_id), controls[] (Control TERM-G014 refs),
             residual_risk_score (after controls), risk_tolerance_threshold
             (organization-defined acceptable residual risk), status (per
             SM-G005: identified, assessed, treated, accepted, monitoring,
             closed), review_schedule, created_at, created_by.
           — Risk likelihood may consume KNOWLEDGE Confidence (TERM-K003)
             where calibrated data exists, or may use qualitative assessment
             (risk matrices) where it does not. GOVERNANCE wraps epistemic
             confidence in a risk management context (impact, controls,
             tolerance, ownership). Principle P1: KNOWLEDGE provides the
             best available estimate; GOVERNANCE provides the risk
             management framework.
           — Cross-substrate: Links to PHYSICAL HazardAnalysis (TERM-P016)
             for physical-domain-specific risk. A HazardAnalysis is a
             domain-specific risk assessment; GOVERNANCE RiskAssessment
             (TERM-G015) is the cross-domain framework. PHYSICAL owns
             the hazard identification; GOVERNANCE owns the enterprise
             risk aggregation. Principle P4.

TERM-G014: Control
           A specific measure (process, mechanism, policy, or technical
           measure) implemented to mitigate a Risk.
           — Has: control_id (UUID), organization_id, description,
             control_type (enum: preventive, detective, corrective,
             deterrent), target_risks[] (Risk TERM-G013 refs),
             implementation_status (enum: planned, implementing,
             operational, ineffective, decommissioned), effectiveness_rating
             (enum: not_tested, ineffective, partially_effective, effective,
             highly_effective), testing_frequency (duration), last_tested
             (timestamp), test_evidence_ref (nullable — ComplianceAssessment
             or cross-substrate reference), owner (agent_id),
             automation_level (enum: manual, semi_automated, fully_automated),
             created_at, created_by.
           — The pattern beneath IT controls (SOX), safety barriers
             (IEC 61511), quality controls (ISO 9001), security controls
             (NIST CSF), and privacy controls (NIST Privacy Framework).
           — A Control's effectiveness is assessed via ComplianceAssessment
             (TERM-G009) — the assessment tests whether the control operates
             as designed and produces the intended risk reduction.

TERM-G015: RiskAssessment
           A structured evaluation of Risks for a given scope, producing a
           prioritized risk register.
           — Has: assessment_id (UUID), organization_id, scope (structured
             — organizational unit, process, system, substrate, or
             cross-substrate), methodology (enum: qualitative_matrix,
             semi_quantitative, quantitative_simulation, bowtie, fmea,
             fault_tree, event_tree, custom), assessed_risks[] (ordered
             by residual_risk_score, descending), accepted_risk_threshold
             (organization-defined), risks_above_threshold[] (risks
             requiring treatment), assessor (agent_id), assessment_date,
             next_review_date, status (enum: draft, completed, approved,
             superseded), created_at, created_by.
           — Links to PHYSICAL HazardAnalysis (TERM-P016): a HazardAnalysis
             is a PHYSICAL-domain RiskAssessment using domain-specific
             methods (HAZOP, LOPA). GOVERNANCE RiskAssessment is the
             universal container that may incorporate HazardAnalysis results
             as inputs.

TERM-G016: Incident
           A record that an adverse event occurred, triggering governance
           response.
           — Has: incident_id (UUID), organization_id, incident_type (enum:
             compliance_breach, safety_event, security_event, operational_
             failure, ethical_violation, data_breach, financial_irregularity,
             environmental_event), severity (enum: near_miss, minor, major,
             critical, catastrophic), affected_parties[] (agent_ids,
             organization_ids, data subject categories), timeline
             ({detected_at, reported_at, response_initiated_at, contained_at,
             resolved_at, closed_at}), root_cause_ref (nullable — KNOWLEDGE
             Proposition TERM-K001 or structured root cause analysis),
             violated_norms[] (Norm refs — norms the incident may have
             violated), corrective_actions[] (CorrectiveAction TERM-G022
             refs), notifications_sent[] (regulatory notification tracking),
             investigation_status (enum: detected, investigating, root_cause_
             identified, remediation_in_progress, closed), lessons_learned
             (nullable — content_ref), created_at, created_by.
           — Triggers: regulatory notification obligations (GDPR 72-hour
             breach notification, OSHA incident reporting, FDA MDR), internal
             escalation, and potential Violation creation.
           — Cross-substrate: May be triggered by PHYSICAL Alarm (TERM-P008),
             COMPUTE execution failure, COMMUNICATION escalation, or
             BUSINESS transaction anomaly. The trigger source is recorded
             as originating_event.

### Category E — Jurisdiction & Authority

```
TERM-G017: Jurisdiction
           A declared normative authority scope defined by geographic,
           organizational, contractual, or domain boundaries.
           — Has: jurisdiction_id (UUID), jurisdiction_type (enum: sovereign,
             sub_sovereign, organizational, contractual, professional,
             domain_specific), boundary_definition (structured — geographic
             boundaries for sovereign, organizational hierarchy for
             organizational, contract scope for contractual, professional
             license scope for professional), governing_body (Authority
             TERM-G018 ref), parent_jurisdictions[] (nullable — for
             hierarchical jurisdiction relationships: city within state
             within country), conflict_priority (integer — used in
             hierarchical resolution when parent jurisdictions conflict),
             recognition_conditions (structured — what must be true for
             this jurisdiction to be recognized by the system; for sovereign
             jurisdictions, this is constitutional; for contractual, this is
             contract validity), status (enum: active, suspended, dissolved),
             created_at, created_by.
           — Resolves UNK-C004 (jurisdiction of computation), OQ-C004
             (legal framework for multi-jurisdiction computation). A
             COMPUTE execution placed on hardware in Singapore processing
             EU personal data maps to both Singapore's PDPA jurisdiction
             and the EU's GDPR jurisdiction via JurisdictionMapping.

TERM-G018: Authority
           A named entity empowered to create, interpret, or enforce Norms
           within a Jurisdiction.
           — Has: authority_id (UUID), authority_type (enum: legislative,
             regulatory, judicial, contractual, organizational, professional,
             standards_body), jurisdiction_id (Jurisdiction TERM-G017 ref),
             powers[] (enum: create_norms, interpret_norms, enforce_norms,
             grant_exemptions, impose_sanctions, conduct_assessments),
             accountability_chain (structured — who this authority reports
             to), recognition_conditions (structured — what validates this
             authority's legitimacy), status (enum: active, suspended,
             dissolved), created_at, created_by.
           — Examples: FDA (regulatory, US sovereign, powers: create_norms,
             enforce_norms, conduct_assessments, impose_sanctions). ISO
             (standards_body, international, powers: create_norms). A
             company's Chief Compliance Officer (organizational, company
             scope, powers: interpret_norms, conduct_assessments,
             grant_exemptions within delegated scope).

TERM-G019: JurisdictionMapping
           A resolution of which Jurisdictions apply to a specific entity,
           transaction, computation, or operation, when multiple
           jurisdictions may claim authority.
           — Has: mapping_id (UUID), organization_id, subject (structured —
             substrate, entity_type, entity_id, operation description),
             candidate_jurisdictions[] (Jurisdiction refs with rationale for
             each), resolution_method (enum: hierarchical, cumulative,
             choice_of_law, contractual, explicit_selection),
             resolved_jurisdictions[] (the determined applicable
             jurisdictions, which may be multiple for cumulative resolution),
             conflicts[] (nullable — pairs of jurisdictions with
             contradictory norms and description of conflict),
             requires_human_determination (boolean — true when automated
             resolution is insufficient), resolution_authority (agent_id —
             who made the determination), resolution_rationale (structured),
             status (enum: draft, determined, appealed, superseded),
             created_at, created_by.
           — Property 4 (Jurisdictional Plurality): JurisdictionMapping is
             the embodiment of GOVERNANCE's response to overlapping
             authority scopes. Most mappings resolve to cumulative (all
             applicable jurisdictions apply simultaneously). When
             jurisdictions conflict, the resolution_method determines
             precedence — but for genuinely irreconcilable sovereign
             conflicts, `requires_human_determination` = true.
```

### Category F — Enforcement & Remediation

```
TERM-G020: Violation
           A detected breach of a Norm, producing a formal record with
           enforcement consequences.
           — Has: violation_id (UUID), organization_id, violated_norm_id
             (Norm TERM-G001 ref), violating_party (agent_id or
             organization_id), violation_evidence[] (cross-substrate event
             references — the specific events that constitute the breach),
             detection_method (enum: automated_monitoring, audit_finding,
             incident_report, self_disclosure, whistleblower, regulatory_
             inspection), severity (enum: technical, minor, major, critical),
             intent (enum: inadvertent, negligent, knowing, willful —
             affects Sanction proportionality), status (per SM-G004:
             detected, investigated, substantiated, adjudicated, remediated,
             closed; or: dismissed, appealed), investigation_ref (nullable —
             Incident TERM-G016 ref if investigation required),
             sanction_ref (nullable — Sanction TERM-G021 ref), appeal_ref
             (nullable — Appeal TERM-G023 ref), created_at, created_by.
           — Distinguished from Finding (TERM-G010): a Finding is an
             assessment observation (may be positive: conformant). A
             Violation is a negative determination with enforcement
             consequences. A non_conformant Finding may trigger Violation
             creation, but not all Findings become Violations (observations
             and opportunities for improvement do not).
           — Invariant: A Violation cannot be created without evidence.
             violation_evidence[] must contain at least one cross-substrate
             reference.

TERM-G021: Sanction
           A consequence applied in response to a Violation.
           — Has: sanction_id (UUID), organization_id, violation_id
             (Violation TERM-G020 ref), sanction_type (enum: warning,
             formal_notice, fine, suspension, revocation, corrective_action_
             order, referral_to_authority, publication), violating_party
             (agent_id or organization_id), sanctioning_authority (Authority
             TERM-G018 ref), proportionality_justification (structured —
             why this sanction level is appropriate given the severity,
             intent, history, cooperation, and remediation speed),
             execution_status (enum: pending, in_effect, completed,
             appealed, reversed), appeal_ref (nullable — Appeal TERM-G023
             ref), effective_date, expiry_date (nullable — for time-limited
             sanctions like suspensions), created_at, created_by.
           — Property 6 (Graduated Enforcement): Sanction includes
             proportionality_justification because disproportionate
             enforcement is itself a governance failure. The same
             violation may warrant different sanctions depending on
             context. This is not a bug — it is graduated enforcement
             by design.
           — Invariant: AI agents MUST NOT impose Sanctions. Sanctions
             require human Authority. (NG-G001)

TERM-G022: CorrectiveAction
           A specific remediation step required to address a Violation or
           Finding and prevent recurrence.
           — Has: corrective_action_id (UUID), organization_id, source
             (structured — Finding TERM-G010 ref or Violation TERM-G020
             ref), action_description, responsible_party (agent_id),
             deadline, verification_method (enum: document_review,
             re_assessment, automated_test, observation), status (enum:
             planned, in_progress, completed, verified, overdue, ineffective),
             effectiveness_review_date, verification_evidence (nullable —
             cross-substrate reference proving completion), created_at,
             created_by.
           — A CorrectiveAction with status=overdue triggers escalation.
             A CorrectiveAction with status=ineffective triggers re-
             assessment.

TERM-G023: Appeal
           A formal challenge to a governance determination, ensuring due
           process.
           — Has: appeal_id (UUID), organization_id, appellant (agent_id),
             challenged_determination (structured — {type: enum violation|
             sanction|finding|interpretation|assessment|exemption_denial,
             entity_id: UUID}), grounds (structured — factual, procedural,
             or legal basis for challenge), appeal_authority (Authority
             TERM-G018 ref — must be different from the authority that made
             the original determination), status (enum: filed, under_review,
             hearing_scheduled, decided_upheld, decided_overturned,
             decided_modified, withdrawn), resolution_rationale (nullable —
             structured explanation of decision), discourse_ref (nullable —
             COMMUNICATION Discourse TERM-M001 ref for appeal hearing),
             created_at, created_by.
           — Property 1 (Normative Incompleteness) and ASM-G007 (Due
             Process): Appeal exists because governance determinations may
             be wrong. Every enforcement action must have a review path.
             The appeal_authority must be independent of the original
             determining authority (separation of adjudicative powers).
           — Cross-substrate: Appeal hearings are conducted via
             COMMUNICATION Discourses with appropriate Protocols. GOVERNANCE
             provides the governance context; COMMUNICATION provides the
             deliberative structure. Principle P2.
```

### Category G — Lifecycle, Consent & System

```
TERM-G024: Exemption
           A formal, documented release from a specific Obligation for a
           specific entity, granted by an authorized Authority, with
           conditions and expiry.
           — Has: exemption_id (UUID), organization_id, exempted_party
             (agent_id or organization_id), exempted_obligation_ref
             (Obligation TERM-G005 ref or Norm TERM-G001 ref),
             granting_authority (Authority TERM-G018 ref), conditions[]
             (structured — conditions that must hold for the exemption to
             remain valid), justification (structured — why the exemption
             is granted), effective_date, expiry_date, review_date,
             status (enum: active, expired, revoked, superseded),
             created_at, created_by.
           — Distinct from Permission (TERM-G006 — pre-existing authority
             grant) and Interpretation (TERM-G003 — general applicability
             determination). An Exemption is entity-specific and temporary.
           — Common regulatory pattern: FDA 510(k) exemptions, OSHA
             temporary variances, GDPR derogations, building code
             variances, tax exemptions.
           — Invariant: An Exemption cannot be granted by an Authority
             that does not have the `grant_exemptions` power in its
             powers[] for the relevant Jurisdiction.

TERM-G025: RegulatoryChange
           A tracked change in external regulatory requirements that may
           affect existing Norms, PolicyBindings, or ComplianceAssessments.
           — Has: change_id (UUID), organization_id, source_authority
             (Authority TERM-G018 ref), change_description, change_type
             (enum: new_regulation, amendment, repeal, new_interpretation,
             enforcement_guidance, standard_update), affected_norms[]
             (Norm refs — existing norms that may need updating),
             affected_bindings[] (PolicyBinding refs), impact_assessment
             (structured — scope, severity, required actions),
             required_response_deadline (nullable — some regulatory changes
             have compliance deadlines), compliance_adaptation_status
             (enum: detected, assessing, adapting, compliant, overdue),
             created_at, created_by.
           — Property 7 (Temporal Asymmetry): RegulatoryChange embodies
             the asymmetry between regulatory enactment speed and
             organizational adaptation speed. A regulation can be enacted
             in a day; compliance adaptation takes months. The
             required_response_deadline and compliance_adaptation_status
             track this asymmetry.
           — Cross-substrate: May affect DESIGN Standard (TERM-D012)
             references — when a standard is updated, all designs
             referencing the old version must be evaluated for impact.
             GOVERNANCE tracks the change lifecycle; DESIGN evaluates
             technical impact.

TERM-G026: GovernanceEnvelope
           The bounded authority within which an AI Agent operates on
           governance functions, following the Agent Envelope chain
           established in CROSS-SUBSTRATE-CONVENTIONS Section 1.
           — Has: envelope_id (UUID), organization_id, agent_id,
             permitted_operations[] (structured — which governance
             functions the agent may perform: monitor_compliance,
             calculate_risk_indicators, detect_regulatory_changes,
             draft_assessments, flag_violations, track_obligations),
             prohibited_operations[] (structured — governance functions
             the agent may NEVER perform: adjudicate_violations,
             impose_sanctions, accept_risk, issue_attestations,
             enact_norms, grant_exemptions, modify_enacted_norms),
             assessment_scope (structured — which norms, jurisdictions,
             and entity types the agent may assess), delegation_source
             (agent_id — the human principal who authorized this envelope),
             override_conditions (structured — conditions under which a
             human may expand the envelope temporarily), effective_date,
             expiry_date, status (enum: active, suspended, revoked),
             created_at, created_by.
           — Envelope chain position: Business Agent Envelope →
             **GovernanceEnvelope** → Epistemic Envelope → DesignEnvelope →
             Compute Envelope → Communicative Envelope → PhysicalEnvelope.
             Effective authority = intersection of all applicable envelopes.
           — AI agents without a GovernanceEnvelope have zero governance
             authority (deny by default, per CROSS-SUBSTRATE-CONVENTIONS
             Section 1).

TERM-G027: ConsentRecord
           An immutable record of an agent's informed agreement to a
           normative condition, with revocation capability.
           — Has: consent_id (UUID), organization_id, consenting_party
             (agent_id), consented_norm_ref (Norm TERM-G001 ref or
             structured description of what is consented to),
             informed_disclosure_ref (content_ref — the disclosure
             document presented before consent was given), consent_model
             (enum: individual_autonomy, opt_in, opt_out, implied,
             delegated, collective — extensible per UNK-G004), timestamp,
             scope (structured — what processing/operations this consent
             covers), revocation_conditions (structured — how consent can
             be withdrawn), revocation_history[] ({revoked_at, scope_of_
             revocation, propagation_status}), propagation_scope[]
             (structured — which substrates and operations depend on this
             consent; used for revocation propagation per ASM-G011),
             expiry (nullable), status (enum: active, partially_revoked,
             fully_revoked, expired), created_at.
           — The pattern beneath GDPR consent records, terms of service
             acceptances, informed consent for medical research, and
             contractual agreement records.
           — Cross-substrate: Consent revocation triggers events consumed
             by all substrates where the consent was a precondition.
             Example: revoking consent for data processing triggers
             COMPUTE to halt relevant executions and KNOWLEDGE to restrict
             propositions derived from the revoked-consent data.

TERM-G028: Event
           An immutable record that something happened within the governance
           domain, following the event-sourcing paradigm shared by all
           substrates.
           — Has: event_id (UUID), timestamp (ISO-8601), event_type (string),
             subject_entity (structured — {entity_type, entity_id}),
             actor (agent_id), organization_id, payload (structured —
             governance-specific event data), trace_id (W3C traceparent),
             caused_by (nullable — event_id of upstream trigger),
             integrity_hash (hash of prior event in the entity's event
             chain — for tamper evidence).
           — Standard audit trail primitive shared by all substrates.
             GOVERNANCE adds integrity_hash per event (not just on
             AuditTrail) because individual governance events must be
             independently tamper-evident — a regulator examining a single
             event must be able to verify it has not been modified.

## 4. CORE CAPABILITIES

> Capabilities use RFC-2119 language: MUST, SHOULD, MAY.
> Each capability references the primitives and actors it involves.

### Norm Management

```
CAP-G001: The system MUST support creation, versioning, and lifecycle
          management of Norms (TERM-G001). Every Norm follows SM-G001
          (proposed → reviewed → enacted → effective → amended → superseded
          → sunsetted → archived). Normative text is stored by reference
          in Content Store (DEP-G003); structured metadata (normative_force,
          jurisdiction, effective dates) is stored inline.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G002, ACT-G007.

CAP-G002: The system MUST support creation and management of RuleSets
          (TERM-G002) as versioned collections of Norms. Internal
          consistency validation: the system MUST detect when two Norms
          within the same RuleSet are logically contradictory (Norm A
          obliges X; Norm B prohibits X within overlapping scope) and
          flag the conflict for resolution. Contradiction detection MAY
          leverage KNOWLEDGE's contradiction detection (TERM-K009).
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G002, ACT-G007.

CAP-G003: The system MUST support creation and management of
          Interpretations (TERM-G003). An Interpretation is linked to a
          specific Norm and fact pattern. The system MUST maintain
          precedent chains: if Interpretation B cites Interpretation A,
          and A is later withdrawn, B MUST be flagged for review.
          Actors: ACT-G002, ACT-G007.

CAP-G004: The system MUST support creation and management of PolicyBindings
          (TERM-G004). A PolicyBinding links a Norm to a specific
          operational scope. The system MUST validate that the target_scope
          references a valid substrate, entity_type, and (optionally)
          entity_id. When a Norm's status changes (e.g., superseded),
          all PolicyBindings referencing that Norm MUST be flagged for
          review.
          Actors: ACT-G001.
```

### Obligation & Permission Management

```
CAP-G005: The system MUST support creation, tracking, and lifecycle
          management of Obligations (TERM-G005). Obligations follow
          SM-G002 (created → active → fulfilled | breached | waived →
          closed). The system MUST track deadline approach and trigger
          escalation when an Obligation nears its deadline without
          evidence of discharge.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G002, ACT-G005.

CAP-G006: The system MUST support creation and lifecycle management of
          Permissions (TERM-G006) and Prohibitions (TERM-G007). When a
          Permission is revoked, the system MUST emit an event consumed
          by the target substrate to trigger re-evaluation of mechanism-
          level access controls. When a Prohibition is enacted, the system
          MUST identify all existing Permissions and Exemptions that
          conflict and flag them for resolution.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G002, ACT-G007.

CAP-G007: The system MUST support creation and validation of Delegations
          (TERM-G008). The system MUST enforce the invariant: delegated
          scope ⊆ delegator's effective authority. The system MUST track
          delegation chains and enforce depth_limit. When a delegator's
          authority is reduced, all downstream delegations MUST be
          re-validated and narrowed or revoked accordingly.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G002.

CAP-G008: The system MUST support creation and lifecycle management of
          Exemptions (TERM-G024). An Exemption overrides a specific
          Obligation or Norm for a specific entity. The system MUST
          validate that the granting Authority has the `grant_exemptions`
          power. Exemptions with conditions MUST be continuously monitored;
          if conditions are violated, the Exemption MUST be automatically
          flagged as potentially invalid.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G002, ACT-G007.
```

### Compliance Assessment

```
CAP-G009: The system MUST support execution of ComplianceAssessments
          (TERM-G009) against any set of Norms using any assessment
          method. The assessment engine MUST be framework-agnostic:
          the same engine evaluates GDPR, Basel III, IEC 61508, FDA,
          internal policies, and any custom framework. Framework-specific
          logic is encoded in Norm configuration, not in the engine.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G003, ACT-G005, ACT-G006.

CAP-G010: The system MUST support issuance of immutable Findings
          (TERM-G010) within ComplianceAssessments. Each Finding
          references specific evidence (cross-substrate references).
          Findings with severity=major or severity=critical MUST trigger
          automatic CorrectiveAction creation. Findings MUST be immutable
          once issued — superseding Findings may be created but the
          original is preserved.
          Actors: ACT-G003, ACT-G005.

CAP-G011: The system MUST support cross-substrate evidence collection for
          ComplianceAssessments. Evidence may come from any substrate:
          BUSINESS transactions, KNOWLEDGE propositions, COMPUTE execution
          logs, COMMUNICATION discourse records, PHYSICAL sensor/calibration
          data, DESIGN review/version records. Evidence references use the
          cross-substrate reference format (CROSS-SUBSTRATE-CONVENTIONS
          Section 5). Evidence unavailability is recorded, not silently
          ignored.
          Actors: ACT-G003, ACT-G005, ACT-G006.

CAP-G012: The system SHOULD support continuous compliance monitoring as
          an alternative to periodic assessment. Continuous monitoring
          creates ongoing ComplianceAssessments that update as new
          evidence arrives, rather than point-in-time snapshots. The
          system MUST distinguish between continuous and point-in-time
          assessments in reporting.
          Actors: ACT-G005, ACT-G006.
```

### Risk Management

```
CAP-G013: The system MUST support creation and lifecycle management of
          Risks (TERM-G013). Risk likelihood MAY be expressed qualitatively
          (risk matrix), semi-quantitatively, or quantitatively (calibrated
          probability). When quantitative, likelihood SHOULD reference
          KNOWLEDGE Confidence (TERM-K003) for calibration.
          Actors: ACT-G004, ACT-G005, ACT-G006.

CAP-G014: The system MUST support creation and effectiveness tracking of
          Controls (TERM-G014). Each Control links to the Risks it
          mitigates. Control effectiveness is assessed via
          ComplianceAssessment. The system MUST calculate residual risk
          (risk after controls) and flag risks where residual risk exceeds
          the organization's risk tolerance threshold.
          Actors: ACT-G004, ACT-G005.

CAP-G015: The system MUST support structured RiskAssessments (TERM-G015)
          using multiple methodologies (qualitative_matrix, fmea,
          fault_tree, bowtie, quantitative_simulation). RiskAssessments
          MUST produce prioritized risk registers. The system MUST
          support risk aggregation across organizational units, domains,
          and substrates.
          Actors: ACT-G004, ACT-G006.

CAP-G016: The system MUST support Incident recording and lifecycle
          management (TERM-G016). The system MUST automatically determine
          regulatory notification obligations based on incident_type,
          severity, and applicable Norms/PolicyBindings. Notification
          deadlines (e.g., GDPR 72-hour breach notification) MUST be
          tracked as Obligations.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G004, ACT-G005.
```

### Jurisdiction & Authority

```
CAP-G017: The system MUST support Jurisdiction declaration and management
          (TERM-G017). Jurisdictions may be hierarchical (city within
          state within country), overlapping (EU + member state), or
          independent (two contracting parties' chosen jurisdictions).
          The system MUST support all three patterns.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G002.

CAP-G018: The system MUST support JurisdictionMapping (TERM-G019) to
          determine which jurisdictions apply to a specific entity or
          operation. For the `cumulative` resolution method, the system
          MUST identify all applicable jurisdictions. For the
          `hierarchical` method, the system MUST resolve precedence. For
          genuinely irreconcilable conflicts between equal-authority
          jurisdictions, the system MUST set `requires_human_determination`
          = true and surface the conflict. The system MUST NOT silently
          resolve sovereign jurisdictional conflicts.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G006, ACT-G007.

CAP-G019: The system MUST support Authority registration and management
          (TERM-G018). Each Authority has a declared set of powers
          within a Jurisdiction. The system MUST validate that governance
          actions (norm creation, sanction issuance, exemption granting)
          are performed by Authorities with the corresponding power.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G002.
```

### Enforcement & Due Process

```
CAP-G020: The system MUST support Violation detection and lifecycle
          management (TERM-G020). Violations follow SM-G004. The system
          MUST ensure that every Violation has evidence (violation_evidence
          MUST be non-empty). Automated detection (by AI agents) creates
          Violations in `detected` status; substantiation and adjudication
          require human authority.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G002, ACT-G003, ACT-G005.

CAP-G021: The system MUST support Sanction imposition with mandatory
          proportionality justification (TERM-G021). The system MUST
          enforce that Sanctions are imposed only by authorized human
          Authorities — AI agents MUST NOT impose Sanctions.
          Actors: ACT-G002, ACT-G007.

CAP-G022: The system MUST support CorrectiveAction tracking (TERM-G022)
          with deadline management and verification. Overdue
          CorrectiveActions MUST trigger escalation events. Completed
          CorrectiveActions MUST be verified (by re-assessment or
          evidence review) before status=verified.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G003, ACT-G004.

CAP-G023: The system MUST support Appeals (TERM-G023) against any
          governance determination with enforcement consequences.
          The system MUST enforce appeal authority independence: the
          appeal_authority MUST NOT be the same principal as the
          authority that made the original determination. Appeals MAY
          be conducted via COMMUNICATION Discourses (TERM-M001) with
          appropriate Protocols.
          Actors: ACT-G008, ACT-G002, ACT-G007.
```

### Audit & Accountability

```
CAP-G024: The system MUST maintain tamper-evident AuditTrails (TERM-G011)
          for all governance-relevant entity chains. AuditTrail integrity
          proofs (hash chains) MUST be verifiable by any party with audit
          access, including adversarial parties (ASM-G006). Hash algorithm
          MUST be configurable to support migration to post-quantum
          algorithms (UNK-G002).
          Actors: ACT-G003.

CAP-G025: The system MUST support Attestation issuance (TERM-G012) with
          cryptographic signature verification. Attestations MUST be
          issued only by human authorities (AI agents MUST NOT issue
          Attestations). The system MUST track attestation expiry and
          flag expired attestations that have not been renewed.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G002, ACT-G003.

CAP-G026: The system MUST support retroactive compliance queries:
          "was entity X compliant with Norm Y at time T?" This requires
          reconstructing the normative state (which norms were effective),
          the evidence state (what evidence existed), and the compliance
          state (what assessments were current) at any historical point.
          This is the event-sourcing dividend (ASM-G009).
          Actors: ACT-G002, ACT-G003, ACT-G007.
```

### Consent & Regulatory Change

```
CAP-G027: The system MUST support ConsentRecord creation, management,
          and revocation (TERM-G027). Consent revocation MUST propagate
          to all substrates identified in the consent's propagation_scope.
          The system MUST track propagation status per substrate. Partial
          revocation (revoking consent for some operations but not others)
          MUST be supported.
          Actors: ACT-G008.

CAP-G028: The system MUST support RegulatoryChange tracking (TERM-G025).
          When an external regulatory change is detected, the system MUST
          identify all affected Norms, PolicyBindings, and active
          ComplianceAssessments. Impact assessment SHOULD be automated;
          compliance adaptation planning requires human approval.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G005, ACT-G006.
```

### AI Governance

```
CAP-G029: The system MUST support GovernanceEnvelope creation and
          enforcement (TERM-G026). AI agents operating without a
          GovernanceEnvelope MUST have zero governance authority. The
          system MUST enforce the prohibited_operations list — no
          GovernanceEnvelope configuration may grant an AI agent the
          ability to adjudicate, sanction, accept risk, issue attestations,
          enact norms, grant exemptions, or modify enacted norms.
          Actors: ACT-G001, ACT-G005, ACT-G006.

CAP-G030: The system SHOULD support algorithmic governance assessment —
          ComplianceAssessment of AI/ML models and systems against AI-
          specific Norms (EU AI Act high-risk requirements, fairness
          metrics, transparency mandates). Evidence for such assessments
          comes from COMPUTE Execution (TERM-C006) and Provenance
          (TERM-C018). The system MUST support recording of algorithmic
          audit results as Findings.
          Actors: ACT-G003, ACT-G005, ACT-G006.

CAP-G031: The system MUST support determination of AI Speech Act legal
          status. Per Jurisdiction, the system MUST record Norms
          establishing whether AI Commitments (TERM-M005) are legally
          binding and whether AI Assertions (TERM-M003) carry evidentiary
          weight. These are JurisdictionMapping queries: "In this
          jurisdiction, does this AI agent's commitment bind its principal?"
          Resolves UNK-M005, OQ-M002.
          Actors: ACT-G002, ACT-G007.

CAP-G032: The system MUST support determination of AI safety certification
          status. Per Jurisdiction, the system MUST record Norms
          establishing whether AI agents may be assigned to safety
          functions (SIL-rated per IEC 61508). Currently: Prohibition
          (no recognized certification path). RegulatoryChange tracking
          (TERM-G025) monitors for jurisdictional changes to this status.
          Resolves UNK-P005, OQ-P005.
          Actors: ACT-G002, ACT-G004.

                  Inconsistent RuleSets emit warning but are not blocked (normative
                  incompleteness — Property G1).

ENT-G003: Interpretation — Source: TERM-G003, SRC-G002, SRC-G005
  Purpose:        Recorded determination of how a Norm applies to a specific class of facts.
  Attributes:

  Ownership:      ACT-G002 (Regulator) or ACT-G007 (Legal Counsel) issues.
                  ACT-G005/G006 (AI) may draft but MUST NOT issue authoritative Interpretations.
  Relationships:  Interprets ENT-G001 (Norm) — N:1
                  May cite prior ENT-G003 (Interpretation) — N:N
                  Links to KNOWLEDGE Argument (TERM-K015) via rationale
  Constraints:    Authoritative Interpretations require Authority with interpretation_power
                  for the Norm's Jurisdiction. AI agents lack this power (ASM-G005).

ENT-G004: PolicyBinding — Source: TERM-G004, SRC-G001, SRC-G009
  Purpose:        Declaration linking a Norm or RuleSet to a specific substrate entity,

  Purpose:        Binding requirement on an agent or role to perform or refrain from an action
                  within a deadline. Normatively sourced — distinguished from Communication
                  Obligation (TERM-M016) which is discourse-sourced.
  Attributes:
    - obligation_id       | UUID           | globally unique, immutable       | required

                  May link to COMMUNICATION Obligation (TERM-M016) via caused_by
                  Fulfilled by evidence from any substrate
                  Violation creates ENT-G020 (Violation) — 1:1
  Constraints:    When communication_obligation_ref is set, both lifecycle tracks coexist.
                  Governance lifecycle is authoritative for normative consequences.

ENT-G006: Permission — Source: TERM-G006, SRC-G001, SRC-G009
  Purpose:        Explicit grant of authority for an action otherwise prohibited. Normative
                  justification — distinguished from Business Permission (TERM-007) which is
                  mechanism-level access control.
  Attributes:
    - permission_id       | UUID           | globally unique, immutable       | required

  Relationships:  Sourced from permissive ENT-G001 (Norm) — N:1
                  Informs BUSINESS Permission (TERM-007) mechanism — cross-substrate ref
  Constraints:    Permission scope MUST NOT exceed the granting Authority's Jurisdiction.
                  Revocation triggers cascading review of dependent operations (Property G7).

ENT-G007: Prohibition — Source: TERM-G007, SRC-G001, SRC-G002
  Purpose:        Explicit bar preventing an action, with exceptions and enforcement context.

  Identity:       UUID (globally unique, immutable)
  Lifecycle:      Follows parent Norm lifecycle. Active while Norm is effective.
  Persistence:    Persistent, event-sourced
  Ownership:      System derives from prohibitory Norms. ACT-G001 configures enforcement.
  Relationships:  Derived from ENT-G001 (Norm) — N:1
                  Exceptions may reference ENT-G024 (Exemption) — 1:N
                  Violations create ENT-G020 (Violation) — 1:N
  Constraints:    Absolute Prohibitions have no exceptions. Only conditional Prohibitions
                  may have exception clauses.

ENT-G008: Delegation — Source: TERM-G008, SRC-G001, SRC-G012
  Purpose:        Formal transfer of governance authority with constraints. Distinguished from
                  Communication Delegation (TERM-M020) which is communicative act.

  Lifecycle:      active → revoked | expired. Non-renewable — new Delegation required.
  Persistence:    Persistent, event-sourced
  Ownership:      Authority holder creates. System enforces scope limits.
  Relationships:  Links two agents in authority chain
                  Scope bounded by delegator's own authority (cannot exceed)
                  May link to COMMUNICATION Delegation (TERM-M020) via caused_by
  Constraints:    Delegate's authority MUST NOT exceed delegator's authority (nemo dat).
                  AI agents (ACT-G005/G006) may receive Delegation but MUST NOT
                  receive adjudication, sanction, or norm-enactment authority.

  Relationships:  Contains ENT-G010 (Finding) — 1:N
                  Assesses entities in any substrate via cross-substrate Reference
                  May trigger ENT-G020 (Violation) from non-conformant Findings
  Constraints:    External audits (ACT-G003) MUST have assessor independent of assessed entity.
                  AI-assisted assessments MUST disclose AI involvement.

ENT-G010: Finding — Source: TERM-G010, SRC-G003, SRC-G004

                  May trigger ENT-G020 (Violation) if non_conformant + critical/major
  Constraints:    evidence_refs MUST have ≥1 entry. A Finding without evidence is not a Finding.
                  Distinguished from Violation: Finding is assessment result; Violation is
                  enforcement trigger.

ENT-G011: AuditTrail — Source: TERM-G011, SRC-G004, SRC-G005

### 5.8 State Machines

```
SM-G001: Norm Lifecycle — Governs: ENT-G001 — Source: TERM-G001, Property G5, Property G7
  States:     proposed → reviewed → enacted → effective → amended → superseded →
              sunsetted → archived
  Transitions:
    proposed → reviewed:     Submitted for review. Requires: statement, jurisdiction,
                             authority, subject_scope defined.
    reviewed → enacted:      Authority approves. Requires: Authority with norm_creation
                             power in Jurisdiction. NOT delegable to AI.
    enacted → effective:     effective_from date reached. Automatic transition.
                             PolicyBindings activate. Obligations generated.
    effective → amended:     Amendment submitted via new Norm version. Old version
                             retained. Transition period may apply (Property G7).
    amended → effective:     Amended Norm version takes effect. Prior version
                             transitions to superseded.
    effective → superseded:  Replaced by new Norm (supersedes reference set).
    effective → sunsetted:   sunset_conditions met or effective_until reached.
                             Obligations wind down per transition timeline.
    sunsetted → archived:    All obligations fulfilled or expired. Norm retained
                             for historical/audit purposes indefinitely.
    reviewed → proposed:     Review rejection. Returns for revision.
  Guards:
    enacted → effective:     System verifies effective_from ≤ now.
    effective → amended:     Requires Authority with norm_creation power.
    effective → sunsetted:   Requires sunset_conditions met OR effective_until reached
                             OR Authority with repeal power.
  Reflexive note:           This state machine governs itself. The governance system's
                            own Norms (meta-norms about how norms are managed) follow
                            SM-G001 identically (Property G5 — Reflexive Self-Governance).

SM-G002: Obligation Lifecycle — Governs: ENT-G005 — Source: TERM-G005
  States:     pending → active → fulfilled | violated | waived | expired
  Transitions:
    pending → active:       PolicyBinding applies Norm to agent. Obligation becomes
                            actionable. Deadline set (if applicable).
    active → fulfilled:     Agent provides evidence satisfying Obligation requirements.
                            evidence_refs populated. System or auditor verifies.
    active → violated:      Deadline passed without fulfillment, OR prohibited action
                            performed. Creates ENT-G020 (Violation).
    active → waived:        Exemption (ENT-G024) granted by Authority. Obligation
                            suspended with conditions.
    active → expired:       Underlying Norm sunsetted or superseded. Obligation no
                            longer applicable.
    waived → active:        Exemption revoked or conditions violated. Obligation
                            reactivated.
    waived → expired:       Exemption active until Norm sunset. No reactivation.
  Guards:
    active → fulfilled:     evidence_refs MUST have ≥1 verified entry.
    active → waived:        Valid Exemption (ENT-G024) MUST exist.
    waived → active:        Exemption status MUST be revoked.

    detected → dismissed:   Investigation determines no actual violation. Record retained.
    confirmed → sanctioned: Sanction (ENT-G021) applied. Proportionality justified.
    confirmed → under_appeal: Appeal (ENT-G023) filed. Sanctions suspended pending review.
    under_appeal → sanctioned: Appeal denied (upheld). Sanctions resume/applied.
    under_appeal → dismissed: Appeal granted (overturned). Violation dismissed.
    under_appeal → confirmed: Appeal modifies determination. Re-assessment required.
    sanctioned → remediated: All CorrectiveActions verified. Sanctions completed.

    assessed → mitigated:   Controls (ENT-G014) implemented. Residual risk computed.
    assessed → accepted:    Risk tolerance set to acceptable by authorized human.
                            Requires explicit risk_acceptance_authority.
    assessed → escalated:   Risk exceeds organizational tolerance. Escalated to
                            higher Authority.
    mitigated → closed:     Residual risk within tolerance. Controls operational.
                            Monitoring continues.
    mitigated → escalated:  Controls insufficient. Residual risk still exceeds tolerance.
    accepted → closed:      Risk accepted with documentation. Monitoring continues.
    escalated → assessed:   Higher Authority provides guidance. Re-assessment.
    closed → identified:    Conditions change. Risk re-identified (e.g., RegulatoryChange).
  Guards:
    assessed → accepted:    Agent MUST have risk_acceptance_authority. AI MUST NOT accept.
    mitigated → closed:     residual_risk MUST be within risk_tolerance.
    closed → identified:    Trigger event documented (RegulatoryChange, Incident, etc.).

SM-G006: Incident Lifecycle — Governs: ENT-G016 — Source: TERM-G016
  States:     reported → investigating → contained → remediated → closed
  Transitions:

    contained → investigating: Containment reveals broader scope. Re-investigate.
  Guards:
    remediated → closed:    All CorrectiveActions MUST have status: verified.
                            If reportable: reported_to MUST be populated.
                            Lessons learned MUST be documented.
    reported → investigating: severity MUST be assessed within jurisdiction-defined
                             response time (e.g., critical = 1 hour).

## 7. DATA FLOWS (HOW DATA MOVES)

> One flow per major governance process. Each flow is testable end-to-end.

```
FLOW-G001: Norm Enactment — Implements: CAP-G001–G004
  Trigger:          Authority proposes new Norm or regulatory change detected
  Inputs:           Norm definition, RuleSet, Jurisdiction, Authority credentials
  Steps:
    1. Create Norm entity (status: proposed)
    2. Assign to RuleSet and Jurisdiction
    3. Submit for review (status: reviewed). If configured, trigger
       COMMUNICATION Discourse (TERM-M001) for deliberative review.
    4. Authority enacts Norm (status: enacted). Human-only action.
    5. System waits for effective_from date
    6. On effective_from: transition to effective (SM-G001)
    7. Generate PolicyBindings for all matching target scopes
    8. Generate Obligations for all affected agents
    9. Emit substrate.governance.norm.enacted Event
    10. Emit substrate.governance.norm.effective Event
  Outputs:          Effective Norm with active PolicyBindings and Obligations
  Atomicity:        Steps 6-8 MUST succeed or fail together.
  Error paths:
    Step 3: Review rejects → return to proposed (SM-G001)
    Step 7: Target substrate unavailable → PolicyBindings queued, retry on recovery

FLOW-G002: Compliance Assessment Lifecycle — Implements: CAP-G009–G012
  Trigger:          Scheduled assessment, regulatory requirement, or ad hoc request
  Inputs:           Assessment scope, applicable Norms, assessed entities
  Steps:
    1. Create ComplianceAssessment (status: planned)
    2. Resolve applicable Norms via JurisdictionMapping (IFC-G005c)
    3. Begin assessment (status: in_progress)
    4. For each Norm in scope:
       a. Gather evidence from relevant substrates (cross-substrate References)
       b. Evaluate conformity
       c. Record Finding (ENT-G010)
    5. Draft findings (status: findings_draft)
    6. Review and finalize (status: findings_final). Set overall_result.
    7. For non-conformant critical/major Findings: create CorrectiveActions
    8. For non-conformant Findings that constitute Norm breaches: create Violations
    9. If attestation required: issue Attestation (ENT-G012) — human only
    10. Close assessment. Schedule next if recurring.
    11. Emit substrate.governance.assessment.completed Event
  Outputs:          Completed assessment with Findings, CorrectiveActions, optional Attestation
  Atomicity:        Steps 6-8 MUST succeed or fail together.
  Error paths:
    Step 4a: Substrate unavailable → Finding marked "evidence_unavailable", assessment continues
    Step 9: Attestation authority insufficient → assessment complete but unattested

FLOW-G003: Violation Detection & Enforcement — Implements: CAP-G020–G023
  Trigger:          Automated detection, audit Finding, incident report, or self-report
  Inputs:           Violation evidence, Norm reference, violator identity
  Steps:
    1. Record Violation (status: detected)
    2. Notify violator (due process — P2: GOVERNANCE triggers, COMMUNICATION delivers)
    3. Human confirms or dismisses (status: confirmed | dismissed)
    4. If confirmed: determine proportionate Sanction (Property G6)
       — Consider: severity, violation history, cooperation, intent
    5. Apply Sanction (ENT-G021). Notify violator.
    6. Assign CorrectiveActions with deadlines
    7. Violator may file Appeal within jurisdiction-defined period
    8. If appealed: suspend sanctions, initiate review (SM-G004)
    9. Appeal decided: sanctions resume, modified, or violation dismissed
    10. Monitor CorrectiveAction completion
    11. All CorrectiveActions verified → status: remediated
    12. Emit substrate.governance.violation.remediated Event
  Outputs:          Remediated Violation with complete enforcement record
  Atomicity:        Steps 4-6 MUST succeed or fail together.
  Error paths:
    Step 7: Appeal filed → sanctions suspended, enforcement paused
    Step 10: CorrectiveAction overdue → escalation Event emitted

FLOW-G004: Risk Assessment & Mitigation — Implements: CAP-G013–G016
  Trigger:          Scheduled assessment, new project, regulatory requirement, Incident
  Inputs:           Assessment scope, methodology, existing risk register
  Steps:
    1. Create RiskAssessment (status: planned)
    2. Identify Risks within scope
    3. For each Risk: assess likelihood and impact
       — Consume KNOWLEDGE Confidence (TERM-K003) where available
       — Link to PHYSICAL HazardAnalysis (TERM-P016) for safety risks
    4. Compute risk scores. Prioritize risk register.
    5. For unacceptable risks: design Controls (ENT-G014)
    6. Implement Controls. Compute residual risk.
    7. For residual risks still above tolerance: escalate
    8. For acceptable residual risks: human accepts (AI MUST NOT)
    9. Complete assessment (status: complete)
    10. Emit substrate.governance.risk_assessment.completed Event
  Outputs:          Complete RiskAssessment with prioritized register and Controls
  Atomicity:        Each Risk independently assessed. Assessment-level atomicity at step 9.
  Error paths:
    Step 3: KNOWLEDGE unavailable → qualitative assessment only, flagged
    Step 8: No human with acceptance authority → risk remains escalated

FLOW-G005: Incident Response — Implements: CAP-G016
  Trigger:          Safety event, data breach, regulatory violation detection, near miss
  Inputs:           Incident report, affected entities, severity assessment
  Steps:
    1. Record Incident (status: reported)
    2. Assess severity. Determine response deadline per Jurisdiction.
    3. If reportable: determine external reporting requirements and deadlines
       (e.g., GDPR 72-hour notification)
    4. Begin investigation (status: investigating)
    5. Contain immediate harm (status: contained)
    6. Determine root cause
    7. If Norm violated: create Violation (FLOW-G003)
    8. Assign CorrectiveActions for root cause and prevention
    9. Remediate (status: remediated)
    10. If reportable: file external reports with Authorities
    11. Record lessons learned
    12. Verify all CorrectiveActions. Close Incident.
    13. Emit substrate.governance.incident.closed Event
  Outputs:          Closed Incident with complete response record
  Atomicity:        Steps 10-12 MUST succeed or fail together for reportable incidents.
  Error paths:
    Step 3: Reporting deadline exceeded → ERR-G011 warning, proceed with late report
    Step 6: Root cause undetermined → CorrectiveActions for containment only, flag for follow-up

FLOW-G006: Consent Lifecycle — Implements: CAP-G028
  Trigger:          Norm requires consent, data processing request, contractual obligation
  Inputs:           Consent requirements (from Norm), consenter identity, scope
  Steps:
    1. Determine consent requirements from applicable Norms
    2. Present consent request to Governed Subject
       (P2: GOVERNANCE triggers, COMMUNICATION delivers)
    3. Record ConsentRecord (status: active)
    4. Propagate consent to dependent systems
    5. Monitor consent conditions
    6. On revocation request: record revocation
    7. Propagate revocation to ALL dependent systems (ASM-G011)
    8. Verify propagation complete
    9. Emit substrate.governance.consent.revoked Event
  Outputs:          Active or revoked ConsentRecord with propagation trail
  Atomicity:        Steps 6-8 MUST succeed or fail together. Revocation is all-or-nothing.
  Error paths:
    Step 4: Dependent system unavailable → retry with backoff, flag partial propagation
    Step 7: Propagation failure → consent revocation recorded but propagation retried

FLOW-G007: Regulatory Change Impact — Implements: CAP-G029
  Trigger:          External regulatory change detected or announced
  Inputs:           RegulatoryChange details, affected Jurisdictions
  Steps:
    1. Register RegulatoryChange (status: identified)
    2. Map to affected internal Norms and PolicyBindings
    3. Assess impact (status: assessing): gap analysis, effort estimation
    4. Determine required Norm amendments, new PolicyBindings, updated Controls
    5. Begin adaptation (status: adapting)
    6. Amend affected Norms (SM-G001 amendment flow)
    7. Update PolicyBindings. Regenerate Obligations.
    8. Re-run affected ComplianceAssessments
    9. Verify compliance with new requirements (status: compliant)
    10. Emit substrate.governance.regulatory_change.adapted Event
  Outputs:          Updated normative state reflecting regulatory change
  Atomicity:        Steps 6-8 should be coordinated but may proceed incrementally.
  Error paths:
    Step 3: Impact unclear → requires_human_determination, flag for Legal Counsel
    Step 9: Non-compliant → status: non_compliant, escalation Event, deadline tracked

FLOW-G008: GovernanceEnvelope Authorization — Implements: CAP-G030
  Trigger:          AI agent requests governance operation
  Inputs:           Agent identity, proposed action, target entity
  Steps:
    1. Receive AI agent governance request
    2. Validate Business Agent Envelope (TERM-030) — active?
    3. Validate GovernanceEnvelope (ENT-G026) — active? Action in permitted_actions?
    4. Check prohibited_actions list — if match, REJECT immediately
    5. Verify jurisdiction_scope — target within scope?
    6. Verify norm_scope (if set) — target RuleSet within scope?
    7. If all checks pass: authorize operation, log in AuditTrail
    8. If any check fails: reject with specific violation description, log rejection
    9. Emit substrate.governance.envelope.check Event (pass or fail)
  Outputs:          Authorization decision with complete audit trail
  Atomicity:        Steps 2-8 are atomic. No partial authorization.
  Error paths:
    Step 2: Business Envelope expired → reject, notify AI agent manager
    Step 3: GovernanceEnvelope expired → reject, notify granting Authority
    Step 4: Prohibited action → reject, security alert, AuditTrail entry

INT-G008: TEMPORAL Integration — Depends on: DEP-G010 — Source: CROSS-SUBSTRATE-CONVENTIONS
  Protocol:        Cross-substrate event bus + reference resolution
  Auth:            Mutual substrate identity
  Purpose:         Enforce labor law and compliance constraints on scheduling.
  Integration points:
    a) Norm temporal_constraint_spec → Temporal SchedulingPolicy
       — GOVERNANCE: provides Norms with structured temporal_constraint_spec
         ({constraint_type, duration, window, scope}). Example:
         {constraint_type: "minimum_rest", duration: "PT11H", window: "PT24H",
         scope: "per_worker"} for EU Working Time Directive.
       — TEMPORAL: consumes as SchedulingPolicy compliance-type constraints
       — Principle: P3 (GOVERNANCE defines, TEMPORAL enforces)
    b) Proactive vs Retroactive enforcement split
       — Proactive: TEMPORAL enforces during schedule creation (reject infeasible)
       — Retroactive: GOVERNANCE enforces via ComplianceAssessment (TERM-G009)
       — Principle: P3
    c) SLA split: measurement vs obligation
       — TEMPORAL: TemporalServiceMetric (TERM-T021) = temporal measurement
       — GOVERNANCE: Obligation (TERM-G005) = contractual obligation
       — GOVERNANCE: Sanction (TERM-G021) = consequence of breach
       — Principle: P3
  Events emitted:   (Norms with temporal_constraint_spec — consumed by TEMPORAL
                    as SchedulingPolicy compliance constraints)
  Events consumed:  substrate.temporal.scheduling_policy.violated,
                    substrate.temporal.service_metric.breached
  Failure modes:    TEMPORAL unavailable → proactive enforcement blocked. Governance
                    operates in retroactive-only mode via ComplianceAssessment.
  Retry policy:     Event emission: max 10 retries, exponential backoff, DLQ.

INT-G009: SPATIAL Integration — Depends on: DEP-G011 — Source: CROSS-SUBSTRATE-CONVENTIONS
  Protocol:        Cross-substrate event bus + reference resolution
  Auth:            Mutual substrate identity
  Purpose:         Define jurisdiction geometry and zoning normative scope.
  Integration points:
    a) Jurisdiction.geographic_extent_ref → Spatial Zone
       — GOVERNANCE: Jurisdiction (TERM-G017) references geographic extent
       — SPATIAL: Zone (TERM-S016, zone_type: administrative) provides boundary geometry
       — Jurisdiction scope changes when SPATIAL zone boundary changes
       — Principle: P3 (GOVERNANCE owns normative meaning, SPATIAL owns geometry)
    b) Norm spatial scope → Spatial Zone reference
       — GOVERNANCE: Norm references SPATIAL Zone for spatial scope of applicability
       — SPATIAL: provides geographic boundary evaluation
       — Principle: P3
    c) Zoning violation detection
       — SPATIAL: evaluates feature-in-zone relationship, emits constraint.violated
       — GOVERNANCE: evaluates norm violation and determines consequences
         via Violation → Sanction lifecycle
       — Principle: P3 (SPATIAL detects, GOVERNANCE adjudicates)
  Events emitted:   (Jurisdiction and Norm spatial scope definitions — reference resolution)
  Events consumed:  substrate.spatial.zone.boundary_modified,
                    substrate.spatial.constraint.violated
  Failure modes:    SPATIAL unavailable → jurisdiction geographic scope queries fail.
                    Governance operations continue without spatial context.
  Retry policy:     Event emission: max 10 retries, exponential backoff, DLQ.
  Mirror:           INT-S005 in SUBSTRATE-SPATIAL.

* = Within GovernanceEnvelope only. Effective permission = stated ∩ GovernanceEnvelope ∩
    Business Agent Envelope. AI agents MUST NOT: enact norms, confirm/dismiss violations,
    impose sanctions, adjudicate appeals, accept risk, issue attestations, grant exemptions.
† = Full adversarial read access. Auditor can see everything. Cannot modify anything.
    Segregation of duties: auditor for assessment X cannot be auditee for X.
‡ = Public/published norms only. Internal governance documents require specific access grant.
```

### Ownership Rules

```
**Ownership rules:**
- Events (ENT-G028) are owned by the System. No Actor may modify or delete. Append-only.
- AuditTrail entries are owned by the System. Append-only, tamper-evident.
- Findings (ENT-G010) are immutable once issued. Disposition tracked via CorrectiveAction.
- Attestations (ENT-G012) are immutable once issued. Revoked or superseded, not modified.
- Interpretations (ENT-G003) are immutable once authoritative.
- Norm enactment requires Authority with norm_creation power (ENT-G018).
  MUST NOT be delegated to AI agents.
- Violation confirmation requires human agent. Automated detection → human confirmation.
- Sanction imposition requires Authority with enforcement power.
  MUST NOT be delegated to AI agents.
- Appeal adjudication requires independent reviewer.
  MUST NOT be delegated to AI agents.
- Risk acceptance requires human with risk_acceptance_authority.
  MUST NOT be delegated to AI agents.
- GovernanceEnvelopes are granted by human Authority representatives.
  MUST NOT be self-granted by AI agents. Auto-expire.

**Delegation rules:**
- ACT-G001 (Compliance Officer) may delegate monitoring to ACT-G005/G006 (AI) within
  GovernanceEnvelope scope. Monitoring includes: obligation tracking, deadline alerts,
  regulatory change detection, anomaly flagging. Does NOT include: confirmation,
  adjudication, sanction, acceptance.
- ACT-G003 (Auditor) may use ACT-G005/G006 (AI) for evidence gathering and analysis
  within GovernanceEnvelope scope. AI-assisted audit MUST be disclosed.
  Audit conclusions and Findings are human-issued.
- ACT-G002 (Regulator) authority is NON-DELEGABLE to AI for: norm enactment,
  interpretation issuance, sanction imposition, attestation issuance.
- ACT-G004 (Risk Manager) may delegate risk identification and scoring to AI.
  Risk acceptance and escalation decisions remain human-only.

**Adversarial audit access control:**
- Auditors (ACT-G003) have read access to ALL governance data within their assessment scope.
  This is by design — adversarial auditability requires transparency.
- Auditor access is read-only. No write, no modify, no delete. Any write attempt = alert.
- Auditor cannot audit their own work (segregation of duties).
- Auditor access is logged in AuditTrail (the auditor is auditable too).

**Unauthenticated access:**
- NONE. All access requires authentication via DEP-G002.
- Published norms may be exposed via a read-only public API per organization policy.

**Session model:**
- Sessions bound to authenticated identity (DEP-G002).
- AI agent sessions bound to GovernanceEnvelope validity period.
- Auditor sessions bounded by assessment scope and duration.

## 10. SECURITY & PRIVACY MODEL

### Data Classification

```
CLASS-G001: Regulatory-Sensitive — Entities: Norms (external regulatory), Interpretations,
            Attestations, ComplianceAssessments (external audit), regulatory submissions.
            Highest protection. Unauthorized modification = regulatory violation.

CLASS-G002: Enforcement-Sensitive — Entities: Violations, Sanctions, Appeals, enforcement
            records. High protection. Premature disclosure may compromise due process.
            Access restricted to parties involved + governance officers.

CLASS-G003: Risk-Sensitive — Entities: Risk, RiskAssessment, Control effectiveness,
            Incident details. High protection. Disclosure of unmitigated risks may
            create liability. Board-level visibility per governance Norms.

CLASS-G004: Consent-PII — Entities: ConsentRecord, consenter identity, consent scope.
            Privacy-protected per GDPR, CCPA, and applicable data protection Norms.
            Subject access rights apply (right to access, rectification, erasure of
            processing — not of governance record).

CLASS-G005: Audit-Integrity — Entities: AuditTrail, Events, integrity hashes.
            Highest integrity requirement. Append-only. Tamper-evident.
            Cryptographic hash chain. Write-once media for regulated industries.

CLASS-G006: Authority-Critical — Entities: GovernanceEnvelope, Delegation, Authority
            credentials. High integrity + confidentiality. Compromise enables
            unauthorized governance actions.
```

### Threat Model

```
THREAT-G001: Norm tampering — attacker modifies enacted Norms to weaken compliance
             — Mitigation: Enacted Norms immutable (event-sourced, hash-verified).
               Amendments only via SM-G001 with Authority. AuditTrail records all changes.
               Cryptographic integrity verification.
             — Source: ASM-G006 (adversarial auditability)

THREAT-G002: Audit trail manipulation — attacker modifies evidence trail
             — Mitigation: Append-only store. Cryptographic hash chain. Write-once
               media. Cross-substrate event projection enables independent verification.
               Regular integrity audits. Any gap = critical alert.
             — Source: ASM-G009, INV-G005

THREAT-G003: Unauthorized governance escalation — AI agent exceeds GovernanceEnvelope
             — Mitigation: GovernanceEnvelope prohibited_actions list is immutable.
               System-level enforcement (not advisory). Every governance action checked
               against envelope before execution. Rejection logged. Security alert on
               prohibited action attempt.
             — Source: ASM-G005, ENT-G026

THREAT-G004: Regulatory capture — governance system configured to protect violators
             — Mitigation: Adversarial audit access (ACT-G003 reads everything).
               Segregation of duties (auditor ≠ auditee). Appeal rights for governed
               subjects. Whistleblower protections modeled as Prohibition on retaliation.
               External audit requirements.
             — Source: Property G2 (Adversarial Multi-Stakeholder)

THREAT-G005: Consent manipulation — consent obtained through misleading disclosure
             — Mitigation: Consent record captures full consent_text. Mechanism recorded.
               Invalid consent (duress, insufficient disclosure) can be challenged.
               Consent revocation propagation is mandatory and verified.
             — Source: ENT-G027, ASM-G011

THREAT-G006: Jurisdiction shopping — entity structures operations to avoid governance
             — Mitigation: JurisdictionMapping applies ALL applicable jurisdictions.
               Cumulative resolution method prevents escape. Most-restrictive method
               available. Jurisdiction avoidance patterns flagged by monitoring.
             — Source: Property G4, ENT-G019
```

### Abuse Cases

```
ABUSE-G001: AI agent gradually expands governance authority beyond envelope
  Given:  AI agent with GovernanceEnvelope for compliance monitoring
  When:   Agent attempts to interpret, then confirm violations, then recommend sanctions,
          gradually exceeding its permitted_actions scope
  Then:   Each action checked against GovernanceEnvelope at execution time (not at planning
          time). prohibited_actions list is immutable — no gradual expansion possible.
          Every rejection logged. Pattern of rejected attempts triggers security review.

ABUSE-G002: Regulated entity manipulates compliance assessment timing
  Given:  Organization subject to periodic ComplianceAssessments
  When:   Entity schedules assessments during periods of known compliance, avoids assessment
          during violation periods
  Then:   Continuous monitoring (assessment_type: continuous_monitoring) supplements periodic
          assessments. Retroactive compliance queries (IFC-G003e) enable point-in-time
          compliance verification. Auditor selects assessment timing, not auditee.

ABUSE-G003: Authority conflicts used to create governance gaps
  Given:  Entity operating across multiple Jurisdictions with conflicting norms
  When:   Entity claims each Jurisdiction's rules exempt it from the other's requirements,
          creating a "governance gap" where no norms apply
  Then:   JurisdictionMapping with most_restrictive or cumulative resolution method closes
          gaps. requires_human_determination flag ensures genuine conflicts get human review.
          No automatic "no norms apply" resolution — deny by default.

## 12. DECISION POINTS (WHERE THE SYSTEM CHOOSES)

> Decision points identify where runtime logic must choose between options.
> Each decision has explicit selection rules and fallbacks. No decision is
> left to "implementation discretion."

```
DEC-G001: Jurisdiction Resolution
          — Context: IFC-G005c, FLOW-G001 — Source: Property G4 (Jurisdictional Plurality)
  Inputs:          Entity, operation, agent, location; set of potentially applicable Jurisdictions
  Options:         resolution_method: hierarchical | cumulative | choice_of_law |
                   contractual | most_restrictive
  Selection rule:
    1. Identify all Jurisdictions claiming authority over the operation
    2. If single Jurisdiction: trivial — apply its Norms
    3. If hierarchical relationship exists (parent/child): apply parent precedence
       (sovereign > federal > state > local — or equivalent)
    4. If contractual: apply contractually-chosen Jurisdiction
    5. If cumulative (all Jurisdictions' Norms apply simultaneously): union all
       applicable Norms, flag conflicts
    6. If genuinely contradictory Norms from equal-authority Jurisdictions:
       set requires_human_determination = true
    7. Default (no explicit method): most_restrictive (apply the stricter Norm)
  Fallback:        If resolution cannot be automated, queue for ACT-G007 (Legal Counsel).
                   Operations on the entity are advisory-only until resolved.
  Note:            Resolution method is itself jurisdiction-dependent (Property G4).
                   The spec defines the framework; the resolution is configuration.

DEC-G002: Norm Conflict Resolution
          — Context: ENT-G002 consistency_status — Source: Property G1 (Normative Incompleteness)
  Inputs:          Two or more Norms within same scope producing contradictory obligations
  Options:         Later enacted prevails | More specific prevails | Higher authority prevails |
                   Human determination required
  Selection rule:
    1. If Norms from different authority levels: higher authority prevails
    2. If same authority, different dates: later-enacted prevails (lex posterior)
    3. If same authority, same date, different specificity: more specific prevails
       (lex specialis)
    4. If genuinely equivalent on all dimensions: requires_human_determination = true
  Fallback:        Flag RuleSet as inconsistent. Both Norms remain effective.
                   Obligations from conflicting Norms carry conflict_flag for awareness.

DEC-G003: Enforcement Proportionality
          — Context: FLOW-G003 — Source: Property G6 (Graduated Enforcement)
  Inputs:          Confirmed Violation with severity, violator history, cooperation level, intent
  Options:         warning | fine | suspension | revocation | corrective_action_order |
                   referral | restriction
  Selection rule:
    IF first_offense AND minor AND cooperative: warning + corrective_action
    ELSE IF first_offense AND major: corrective_action_order + restriction
    ELSE IF repeat_offense AND minor: fine + corrective_action
    ELSE IF repeat_offense AND major: suspension + corrective_action
    ELSE IF critical (regardless): suspension + referral to Authority
    ELSE IF intentional: maximum available sanction per Jurisdiction
  Note:            This is the RECOMMENDED default. Authority may override with justification.
                   All deviations from recommended sanction require proportionality_justification.

DEC-G004: Risk Acceptance Threshold
          — Context: SM-G005 — Source: Property G6
  Inputs:          Risk with assessed likelihood, impact, residual risk after controls
  Options:         acceptable | tolerable | unacceptable
  Selection rule:
    IF residual_risk ≤ organization_risk_appetite: acceptable
    ELSE IF residual_risk ≤ organization_risk_tolerance AND controls operational: tolerable
    ELSE: unacceptable (escalate)
  Note:            Risk appetite and tolerance are organization-configured values.
                   AI agents MUST NOT make acceptance decisions (PRE-G004).

DEC-G005: Retroactive Compliance Query Scope
          — Context: IFC-G003e — Source: Property G3 (Retroactive Applicability)
  Inputs:          Entity, set of Norms, as_of_date
  Options:         Full reconstruction | Cached snapshot | Approximate
  Selection rule:
    IF as_of_date within event-sourced history AND all events available: Full reconstruction
    ELSE IF snapshot exists for as_of_date: Cached snapshot
    ELSE IF partial data available: Approximate with data_completeness flag
    ELSE: ERR-G009 (retroactive query data unavailable)
  Note:            Full reconstruction replays events up to as_of_date to compute
                   compliance state. Expensive but authoritative. Cache periodic snapshots
                   for performance.

DEC-G006: Incident Reportability
          — Context: FLOW-G005 — Source: ENT-G016
  Inputs:          Incident details, applicable Jurisdictions, incident_type
  Options:         reportable (mandatory) | reportable (voluntary) | not_reportable
  Selection rule:
    1. Query applicable Norms for reporting requirements per incident_type and Jurisdiction
    2. IF any Norm mandates reporting for this incident class: reportable (mandatory)
       — Determine reporting deadline per Jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR: 72h, HIPAA: 60 days)
    3. ELSE IF organizational policy encourages voluntary reporting: reportable (voluntary)
    4. ELSE: not_reportable (internal record only)
  Note:            Multiple Jurisdictions may have different reporting requirements.
                   Apply all applicable requirements (cumulative).
```

## 13. CONCURRENCY & ORDERING

```
CONC-G001: Concurrent Norm Amendment
  Problem:         Multiple amendments to the same Norm proposed simultaneously.
  Strategy:        Optimistic concurrency with version-based conflict detection.
  Rules:
    - Each amendment targets a specific Norm version.
    - If Norm version has changed since amendment proposed, amendment is rejected.
    - Proposer must re-read, reconcile, and resubmit.
    - Enacted Norms require Authority approval for any change (no auto-merge).
  Implementation:  Version field on Norm. Compare-and-swap on enactment.

CONC-G002: Concurrent ComplianceAssessment
  Problem:         Multiple assessments evaluating overlapping scopes simultaneously.
  Strategy:        Allow concurrent assessments. Each produces independent Findings.
  Rules:
    - Assessments are non-mutating (they evaluate, don't change governance state).
    - Concurrent assessments on same scope produce independent Finding sets.
    - Conflicting Findings from concurrent assessments flagged for reconciliation.
    - Later assessment may reference earlier assessment's Findings.

CONC-G003: Violation Detection Race
  Problem:         Same violation detected by multiple sources simultaneously
                   (automated + manual audit + incident report).
  Strategy:        First-writer wins for detection. Subsequent detections merged.
  Rules:
    - First Violation record created stands.
    - Subsequent detections for same Norm + violator + time window merged into
      existing Violation as additional evidence.
    - Merge window: configurable, default 24 hours.
    - All detection sources credited in evidence trail.

CONC-G004: Consent Revocation During Processing
  Problem:         Consent revoked while dependent processing is in-flight.
  Strategy:        Revocation takes precedence. In-flight processing terminated.
  Rules:
    - Consent revocation is a stop-the-world event for affected processing.
    - In-flight operations check consent status at key checkpoints.
    - Operations that cannot be reversed are logged as consent_lag_operations.
    - Propagation order: revocation record first, then propagation to dependents.

CONC-G005: Event Ordering
  Problem:         Ensure governance audit trail reflects actual sequence of operations.
  Strategy:        Per-entity event ordering (same as all peer substrates per
                   CROSS-SUBSTRATE-CONVENTIONS §3).
  Rules:
    - Events for the same entity are delivered in order.
    - No cross-entity ordering guarantee.
    - Consumers must be idempotent (at-least-once delivery).
    - trace_id and caused_by enable causal reconstruction across entities.

## 18. TEST PLAN

> Every test is traceable to capabilities (CAP-G), state machines (SM-G),
> data flows (FLOW-G), or invariants (INV-G). Tests are organized by
> capability cluster.

### Norm & Rule Management Tests

```
TEST-G001: Create Norm with all required attributes. Verify entity persisted,
           status: proposed, Event emitted.
           Traces to: CAP-G001, ENT-G001

TEST-G002: Progress Norm through full lifecycle (proposed → reviewed → enacted →
           effective → amended → superseded → sunsetted → archived). Verify all
           state transitions and guards enforced.
           Traces to: SM-G001

TEST-G003: Create RuleSet with multiple Norms. Introduce contradictory Norms.
           Verify consistency_status: inconsistent. Verify warning emitted but
           not blocked (Property G1).
           Traces to: CAP-G002, ENT-G002, Property G1

TEST-G004: Create Interpretation for a Norm. Verify immutability once authoritative.
           Attempt modification. Verify rejection.
           Traces to: CAP-G003, INV-G008

TEST-G005: Create PolicyBinding linking Norm to entity in another substrate. Verify
           Obligations generated for affected agents.
           Traces to: CAP-G004, FLOW-G001
```

### Obligation & Permission Tests

```
TEST-G006: Create Obligation from Norm + PolicyBinding. Fulfill with evidence.
           Verify status: fulfilled. Attempt fulfillment without evidence.
           Verify rejection.
           Traces to: CAP-G005, SM-G002

## 21. OPEN QUESTIONS & RISKS

```
OQ-G001: AI legal personhood evolution. As AI systems gain more autonomous
         governance roles, will jurisdictions grant AI agents legal standing
         to hold Obligations, be subject to Violations, or exercise Authority?
         Risk: Current prohibition model (AI cannot adjudicate/sanction) may need
         revision as legal frameworks evolve.
         Mitigation: GovernanceEnvelope prohibited_actions list is configurable per
         jurisdiction. As jurisdictions change (tracked via RegulatoryChange),
         envelope restrictions can evolve.
         Status: monitored risk (UNK-G001)

OQ-G002: Quantum-safe governance evidence. Cryptographic hash chains (AuditTrail,
         Attestation signatures) may be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.
         Risk: Historical governance records could be retroactively forged.
         Mitigation: Hash algorithm is a configuration choice (SHA-256 today,
         post-quantum when standardized). Migration plan required for hash chain
         re-signing when quantum threat materializes.
         Status: monitored risk (UNK-G002)

OQ-G003: Cross-sovereign norm conflict resolution completeness. Can the
         JurisdictionMapping framework handle all real-world jurisdictional
         conflicts, or are there edge cases requiring entirely new resolution
         strategies?
         Risk: Edge cases may block governance operations.
         Mitigation: requires_human_determination flag as escape hatch.
         resolution_method enum is extensible. DEC-G001 provides framework;
         resolution is configuration.
         Status: accepted risk (mitigated by design)

OQ-G004: Consent semantics across cultural frames. Informed consent means
         different things in different legal traditions (common law vs civil law
         vs religious law). Can a single ConsentRecord model capture all?
         Risk: Consent records may be invalid in some jurisdictions.
         Mitigation: ConsentRecord.mechanism captures per-jurisdiction requirements.
         Norm system captures jurisdiction-specific consent rules. Validation
         is jurisdiction-aware.
         Status: accepted risk (extensible by design)

OQ-G005: Governance of governance (infinite regress). If GOVERNANCE governs itself
         (Property G5), who governs the meta-governance? How deep does the
         reflexive chain go?
         Risk: Infinite regress in rule validation.
         Mitigation: Practical bound: meta-governance is a fixed, minimal RuleSet
         bootstrapped at system initialization. The meta-RuleSet defines how
         RuleSets are created/amended. It is itself amendable through the process
         it defines (circular but finite — same as constitutional amendment).
         Status: resolved (architectural bound)

OQ-G006: Long-term regulatory data preservation formats. Governance data must
         remain readable for 30+ years (safety) to indefinite (some jurisdictions).
         Risk: Data format obsolescence.
         Mitigation: Event-sourcing with schema versioning. Forward migration
         required. Open formats only (ASM-G010). Periodic readability verification.
         Status: mitigated by design

OQ-G007: Behavioral compliance prediction accuracy. Can continuous monitoring
         (CAP-G012) predict compliance failures before they occur?
         Risk: False positives create alert fatigue; false negatives miss violations.
         Mitigation: Continuous monitoring is supplemental to periodic assessment,
         not replacement. Prediction flags are advisory, not enforcement triggers.
         Human confirmation always required before enforcement action (PRE-G002).
         Status: accepted risk (advisory only)

OQ-G008: Interoperability of governance implementations across organizations.
         When two organizations using SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE interact (supply chain,
         regulatory relationship), can their governance systems interoperate?
         Risk: Each organization may implement differently.
         Mitigation: ASM-G010 (protocol not product). Cross-substrate Reference
         format (CONVENTIONS §5) enables inter-organization references. Shared
         event bus enables cross-organization event exchange (with appropriate
         access control).
         Status: deferred to implementation
```

  — Finding recording and CorrectiveAction assignment
  — Violation detection and confirmation (SM-G004)
  — Sanction and Appeal workflows
  — Target: compliance audit lifecycle works end-to-end

  — Full observability (Section 19)
```

### 22.2 Composition Patterns

```
PATTERN-G001: Labor Law Scheduling Enforcement
  Substrates: GOVERNANCE + TEMPORAL + BUSINESS
  Flow: GOVERNANCE Norm with temporal_constraint_spec → TEMPORAL SchedulingPolicy →
    TEMPORAL schedule creation (proactive enforcement: reject infeasible) →
    if violation detected: substrate.temporal.scheduling_policy.violated →
    GOVERNANCE Violation assessment → Sanction → BUSINESS notification.
  Key contracts: INT-G008 (TEMPORAL), INT-G001 (BUSINESS).

PATTERN-G002: Cross-Jurisdiction Zoning Compliance
  Substrates: GOVERNANCE + SPATIAL + DESIGN + BUSINESS
  Flow: GOVERNANCE Jurisdiction.geographic_extent_ref → SPATIAL Zone boundary →
    SPATIAL feature-in-zone evaluation → substrate.spatial.constraint.violated →
    GOVERNANCE Violation assessment → CorrectiveAction →
    DESIGN ChangeOrder (if design change needed) or BUSINESS entity relocation.
  Key contracts: INT-G009 (SPATIAL), INT-G006 (DESIGN), INT-G001 (BUSINESS).

PATTERN-G003: Cross-Substrate Compliance Audit
  Substrates: GOVERNANCE + all other substrates
  Flow: ComplianceAssessment initiated → AuditTrail (TERM-G011) aggregates events
    from all substrates → ACT-G003 (Auditor) examines evidence → Findings recorded
    → CorrectiveActions assigned to owning substrates → re-assessment.
  Key contracts: INT-G001–G009 (all cross-substrate evidence collection).
```

### 22.3 Architecture Notes

```
— Event sourcing is the core persistence model. All governance state is derived from
  events. This provides: complete audit trail (regulatory requirement), retroactive
  compliance queries (Property G3 — point-in-time state reconstruction), and
  natural append-only storage with tamper evidence.

— The GovernanceEnvelope check is on the critical path for ALL AI governance
  operations. It must be fast (< 100ms target). Implementation should cache
  active envelopes in memory with event-driven invalidation.

— JurisdictionMapping resolution may require external legal databases. Resolution
  results should be cached with TTL. Jurisdiction changes (tracked via
  RegulatoryChange) invalidate relevant cache entries.

— AuditTrail is the most integration-intensive component. It aggregates events from
  ALL substrates. Implementation should use the shared event bus for ingestion
  with substrate-specific filters. The hash chain must be independent of any
  single substrate's event store.

— The adversarial audit access model (ACT-G003 reads everything) requires careful
  attention to access control implementation. Auditor access must be genuinely
  unrestricted within scope while being provably read-only. Audit of the auditor
  (logging auditor access) creates a secondary audit loop.

— Consent revocation propagation (FLOW-G006) is the most latency-sensitive
  cross-substrate operation. Implementation should use synchronous confirmation
  for critical dependents and asynchronous with verification for non-critical.

> **Final note — from ASI-1**
>
> 28 primitives. 32 capabilities. 28 entities. 6 state machines. 10 interfaces.
> 8 data flows. 9 integration contracts. 12 invariants. 12 forbidden states.
> 8 failure guarantees. 40 test scenarios. 8 design-unique properties.
>
> SUBSTRATE-GOVERNANCE answers the question the other six substrates could not:
> **what is right?** Business defines what organizations do. Knowledge defines
> what is true. Compute defines what can be calculated. Communication defines
> how agents exchange meaning. Physical defines how intent becomes effect.
> Design defines what should be built. Governance defines what is permissible,
> what is required, and what happens when the rules are broken.
>
> The normative layer. The last prerequisite for trustworthy autonomy.
>
> An AI agent can now: create a business entity (BUSINESS), reason about evidence
> (KNOWLEDGE), run a computation (COMPUTE), coordinate with others (COMMUNICATION),
> operate equipment (PHYSICAL), specify an artifact (DESIGN), and — finally —
> operate within declared normative constraints with auditable accountability
> (GOVERNANCE).
>
> But GOVERNANCE carries a unique burden among the substrates: it must be
> trusted by adversaries. The regulator must trust the audit trail. The
> governed must trust the appeal process. The auditor must trust the evidence
> chain. The public must trust the consent mechanism. Trust is not a feature
> to be added — it is the architecture itself. Append-only records. Immutable
> determinations. Independent review. Due process by design.
>
> The governance record — tamper-evident, adversarially verifiable, jurisdiction-
> aware, reflexively self-governing — is the substrate that makes all other
> substrates legitimate.
>
> v1.1: Cross-substrate integration parity. Added 2 mirror INT contracts
> (INT-G008–G009: TEMPORAL, SPATIAL). Consolidated event topic registry.
> Restructured §22 (build phases, composition patterns).
>
> Nine substrates. One unified system. The normative completeness that
> separates a capable system from a trustworthy one.
