## 1. Chapter Architecture

### Domain 1: CHO -- Choice (Chapters 1--2)

#### Chapter 1: Scarcity, Choice, and Tradeoffs
*Items introduced: 9 (PRIM-CHO001--005, DEF-CHO001--002, AX-CHO001, DEF-CHO003 partial setup)*
*OpenStax source: Ch 1 + Ch 2 + Ch 19 (comparative advantage moved here per taxonomy ownership)*

| Section | Title | Items Introduced | Action |
|---------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 1.1 | Scarcity: The Root of All Economics | PRIM-CHO001 (scarcity reasoning), AX-CHO001 (rational self-interest) | ADAPT from OpenStax Ch 1 |
| 1.2 | Opportunity Cost: The True Price of Every Choice | PRIM-CHO002 (opportunity cost reasoning) | ADAPT from OpenStax Ch 1--2 |
| 1.3 | Thinking at the Margin | PRIM-CHO003 (marginal analysis) | ADAPT from OpenStax Ch 2 |
| 1.4 | Incentives: Predicting Behavior Change | PRIM-CHO004 (incentive reasoning) | ADAPT from OpenStax Ch 1 |
| 1.5 | The Production Possibilities Frontier | DEF-CHO001 (PPF), DEF-CHO002 (diminishing marginal returns) | ADAPT from OpenStax Ch 2 |
| 1.6 | Specialization and Comparative Advantage | PRIM-CHO005 (trade and specialization), DEF-CHO003 (comparative advantage) | ADAPT from OpenStax Ch 19 |
| -- | Chapter Summary | All 9 CHO items | -- |

*Decision note*: The gap analysis (03-GAP-ANALYSIS.md Section 3.2) proposed splitting CHO into two chapters (Ch 1 for core, Ch 2 for trade/specialization). For the stress test, we merge into a single chapter because all CHO items are tightly connected and comparative advantage requires only opportunity cost as prerequisite. Instructors who prefer two sessions can split at Section 1.6.

#### Chapter 2: [RESERVED -- Specialization and Trade expanded treatment]
*Not written for stress test. If the single-chapter CHO treatment proves too dense, Section 1.6 becomes Chapter 2.*

## 3. CP Deployment Map

| CP | Name | Deployment Chapter | Deployment Section | Rationale |
|----|------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| CP-001 | How Prices Allocate Scarce Resources | Ch 3 | 3.3 (Equilibrium) | Deploys after the last required primitive (PRIM-MKT003) is introduced. Reasoning Chain callout: from scarcity through individual decisions to market equilibrium. |
| CP-002 | Why Trade Makes Both Sides Better Off | Ch 1 | 1.6 (Specialization) | Deploys in the CHO chapter where comparative advantage is introduced. MAC component (GDP reasoning) is forward-referenced. |
| CP-003 | Tax Incidence and Deadweight Loss | Ch 12 | 12.2 (Tax Incidence) | Deploys where DEF-POL002 is introduced. Requires PRIM-MKT004 (Ch 4) and DEF-MKT005 (Ch 5), both already covered. |
| CP-004 | How the Fed Fights Recession | Ch 14 | 14.2 (Monetary Policy in Action) | Deploys after PRIM-POL003 (Ch 14) is introduced. All MON and MAC prerequisites already covered. |
| CP-005 | The Minimum Wage Debate | Ch 12 | 12.1 (Correcting Market Failures) or 12.0 | Deploys where POL axioms and market failure correction are discussed. Requires DEF-MKT003 (Ch 3) and PRIM-MKT004 (Ch 4), already covered. |
| CP-006 | Inflation and the Cost of Living | Ch 10 | 10.4 (Inflation) | Deploys after PRIM-MAC003 and PRIM-MAC004 are introduced. MON prerequisites (money supply reasoning) from Ch 8 already covered. |
| CP-007 | Correcting Pollution Externalities | Ch 12 | 12.1 (Correcting Externalities) | Deploys where PRIM-POL001 is introduced. Requires DEF-MKT006 (Ch 7), already covered. Reasoning Chain callout: from externality diagnosis to three correction approaches. |

### CP Prerequisite Verification

All CPs deploy AFTER their last required primitive is introduced in the linearized sequence. Verified by checking the topological order:

| CP | Last Required PRIM/DEF | Introduced In | Deployed In | Order OK? |
|----|----------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| CP-001 | PRIM-MKT003 | Ch 3 | Ch 3, Section 3.3 | YES (same chapter, after introduction) |
| CP-002 | PRIM-MAC001 | Ch 10 | Ch 1 (forward ref to MAC) | PARTIAL -- CHO primitives all available; MAC GDP is forward-referenced |
| CP-003 | DEF-POL002 | Ch 12 | Ch 12, Section 12.2 | YES |
| CP-004 | PRIM-POL003 | Ch 14 | Ch 14, Section 14.2 | YES |
| CP-005 | AX-POL001 | Ch 12 | Ch 12 | YES |
| CP-006 | PRIM-MAC004 | Ch 10 | Ch 10, Section 10.4 | YES (MON items from Ch 8 already available) |
| CP-007 | PRIM-POL001 | Ch 12 | Ch 12, Section 12.1 | YES |

*Note on CP-002*: The full 3-domain version (CHO x MKT x MAC) cannot deploy until Ch 10 (MAC). In Ch 1, we deploy the CHO-only core of the pattern (comparative advantage + mutual gains), with a forward reference noting that the GDP impact will be formalized in Ch 10.

## 4. Notation/Terminology Concordance

### Mathematical Notation

| Symbol | Meaning | First Introduced | Convention |
|--------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| P | Price | Ch 1 (informally), Ch 3 (formally) | Italicized in text; vertical axis on S/D diagrams |
| Q | Quantity | Ch 3 | Horizontal axis on S/D diagrams |
| P* | Equilibrium price | Ch 3, Section 3.3 | Star denotes equilibrium |
| Q* | Equilibrium quantity | Ch 3, Section 3.3 | Star denotes equilibrium |
| Q_d | Quantity demanded | Ch 3, Section 3.1 | Subscript d for demand |
| Q_s | Quantity supplied | Ch 3, Section 3.2 | Subscript s for supply |
| MB | Marginal benefit | Ch 1, Section 1.3 | Always spelled out on first use per chapter |
| MC | Marginal cost | Ch 1, Section 1.3 | Always spelled out on first use per chapter |
| OC | Opportunity cost | Ch 1, Section 1.2 | Used in semi-formal contexts only |
| E_d | Price elasticity of demand | Ch 4 | Absolute value convention: report as positive number |
| E_s | Price elasticity of supply | Ch 4 | Always positive |
| GDP | Gross domestic product | Ch 10 | Always spelled out on first use |
| CPI | Consumer price index | Ch 10, Section 10.4 | Always spelled out on first use |
| C, I, G, NX | GDP expenditure components | Ch 10, Section 10.1 | C = consumption, I = investment, G = government, NX = net exports |
| AD | Aggregate demand | Ch 11 | |
| AS | Aggregate supply | Ch 11 | SRAS (short-run) and LRAS (long-run) distinguished |
| MPC | Marginal propensity to consume | Ch 13 (Enrichment) | |

### Terminology Decisions

| Term | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| "Marginal" | Always define as "additional" or "one-more-unit" on first use per chapter | Threshold concept; students need consistent anchoring |
| "Equilibrium" | Define as "the point where opposing forces balance" before formalism | Avoids math-anxiety; the concept is accessible before the graph |
| "Real" vs. "nominal" | Always pair: "real (inflation-adjusted)" and "nominal (not adjusted)" | Students confuse these; the parenthetical keeps them distinct |
| "Demand increases" | Always distinguish from "quantity demanded increases" | Most common student error; flag in text and practice questions |
| "Supply shifts" | Same treatment: "supply increases" vs. "quantity supplied increases" | Parallel to demand terminology |
| "Scarcity" | Never use as synonym for "poverty" | Common misconception; address explicitly in Ch 1 |
| "Opportunity cost" | Always state as "the value of the best forgone alternative" | Full phrase prevents partial understanding |
| "Recession" | Define as "two consecutive quarters of declining real GDP" | Common shorthand; note that the NBER definition is broader |
| "Inflation" | Always "a sustained increase in the general price level" | Prevents conflation with one-time price jumps or individual market price changes |

### Graphical Conventions

| Convention | Standard |
|------------|----------|
| Axes | Vertical = Price (or Price level); Horizontal = Quantity (or Real GDP) |
| Demand curve | Labeled D, downward-sloping, drawn as straight line for simplicity |
| Supply curve | Labeled S, upward-sloping, drawn as straight line for simplicity |
| Equilibrium | Dot at intersection; dashed lines to axes showing P* and Q* |
| Shifts | New curve drawn parallel, labeled D' or S'; arrow showing direction |
| Surplus areas | CS = triangle below D, above P*; PS = triangle above S, below P* |
| DWL | Shaded triangle between S and D, from distorted Q to Q* |

*Note*: For the stress test text (Markdown), all graphs are described in words per ASM-GLB002 (no calculus, minimal graphs). In a full textbook, simple supply-demand diagrams would be included.
