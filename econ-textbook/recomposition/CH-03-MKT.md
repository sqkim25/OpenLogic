# Chapter 3: Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium

*Domain: MKT (Markets) -- How prices coordinate decisions*

---

In Chapter 1, you learned how individuals make decisions: they face scarcity, weigh opportunity costs, think at the margin, and respond to incentives. But that analysis stopped at the individual level. One consumer deciding how many avocados to buy. One firm deciding how many workers to hire. One student deciding how many hours to study.

Now we ask a different question: **What happens when millions of individuals make these decisions simultaneously?**

A grocery store in Minneapolis stocks exactly enough bread for the day. No central planner told the bakery how much to produce or the store how much to order. No government agency calculated how much bread Minneapolis needs. Yet somehow, the right amount appears on the shelves. How?

The answer is the price system -- the market mechanism by which individual decisions about buying and selling are coordinated into an organized outcome. This chapter introduces the three core tools of market analysis: demand, supply, and equilibrium. Together, they explain how prices emerge, why they change, and what happens when governments try to override them.

## MKT.1: Demand -- What Buyers Do

### The Law of Demand

When avocado prices spike to $3 each, you buy fewer avocados. When they drop to $1, you buy more. This is not a deep psychological insight -- it is a predictable pattern rooted in the choice logic from Chapter 1: at higher prices, the marginal cost of each avocado is higher relative to its marginal benefit, so you buy fewer.

This pattern is so reliable that economists call it a law.

### **PRIM-MKT001: Demand Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a change in the price of a good or a change in a non-price factor (income, preferences, prices of related goods, expectations, population), determine the direction and nature of the effect on the quantity demanded or the position of the demand curve.

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO003 (marginal analysis -- the demand curve reflects diminishing marginal benefit, Chapter 1), PRIM-CHO004 (incentive reasoning -- demand responds to price incentives, Chapter 1), AX-CHO001 (rational self-interest -- consumers maximize well-being, Chapter 1)*

Demand reasoning operates on two levels:

**Level 1 -- The Law of Demand**: When the price of a good rises (all else equal), the quantity demanded falls. When the price falls, the quantity demanded rises. This is a **movement along** the demand curve.

Why does this happen? Two reasons rooted in Chapter 1:
- *Substitution effect*: When avocados get expensive, you switch to cheaper alternatives (bananas, hummus). Incentive reasoning (PRIM-CHO004) predicts this switch.
- *Diminishing marginal benefit*: The third avocado this week is worth less to you than the first. At a higher price, only the high-value units are worth buying. Marginal analysis (PRIM-CHO003) predicts this cutoff.

**Level 2 -- Demand Shifters**: Sometimes the ENTIRE demand curve shifts -- at every price, consumers want more (or less). This happens when a non-price factor changes:

| Shifter | Demand Increases (shifts right) | Demand Decreases (shifts left) |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Income (normal good) | Income rises | Income falls |
| Preferences | Good becomes more popular | Good becomes less popular |
| Price of substitutes | Substitute becomes more expensive | Substitute becomes cheaper |
| Price of complements | Complement becomes cheaper | Complement becomes more expensive |
| Expectations | Expect future price increase | Expect future price decrease |
| Population | More buyers enter market | Buyers leave market |

**The critical distinction**: A change in price causes a **movement along** the demand curve (change in quantity demanded). A change in a non-price factor causes a **shift of** the demand curve (change in demand). Confusing these two is the most common error in market analysis.

**Real-world example**: In 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns began, the demand for home fitness equipment shifted dramatically to the right -- at every price, more people wanted Peloton bikes, dumbbells, and yoga mats. This was a demand shift (preferences changed) not a movement along the curve (price did not cause the increased demand; increased demand caused higher prices).

---

### **DEF-MKT001: Demand Curve**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a set of price-quantity pairs representing buyers' willingness to pay, construct the demand curve and read it to determine quantity demanded at any given price, or the maximum price consumers will pay for any given quantity.

*Depends on: PRIM-MKT001 (demand reasoning -- the demand curve is the graphical representation of demand, Chapter 3)*

The demand curve is a graph with price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. It slopes downward (law of demand). You can read it two ways:

- **Horizontally**: "At a price of $2, consumers will buy 500 units."
- **Vertically**: "For the 500th unit, the maximum a consumer will pay is $2." (This vertical reading gives you the **marginal benefit** of that unit.)

When a non-price factor changes, the entire curve shifts. When only price changes, you slide along the existing curve.

**Real-world example**: When a concert sells out instantly, the demand curve tells you the ticket price was set below the market-clearing level. There are more people willing to pay the listed price than there are seats. The gap between the ticket price and what scalpers charge approximates how far below equilibrium the price was set.

### Practice Questions: MKT.1

1. Coffee prices rise from $4 to $6 per cup. Is this a movement along the demand curve or a shift of the demand curve? What happens to the quantity of coffee demanded?

2. A celebrity endorses a new brand of sneakers. Is this a movement along the demand curve or a shift? In which direction does the curve shift?

3. The price of peanut butter rises. What happens to the demand for jelly (a complement)? What happens to the demand for almond butter (a substitute)?

4. Explain why "an increase in demand" and "an increase in quantity demanded" are different statements. Give an example of each.

---

## MKT.2: Supply -- What Sellers Do

### The Law of Supply

When the price of coffee beans rises, farmers plant more coffee trees. When gas prices are high, oil companies drill more wells. When starting salaries for software engineers rise, more students enroll in computer science programs.

Sellers respond to prices too -- but in the opposite direction from buyers. Higher prices motivate more production.

---

### **PRIM-MKT002: Supply Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a change in the price of a good or a change in a non-price factor (input costs, technology, number of sellers, expectations, regulation), determine the direction and nature of the effect on the quantity supplied or the position of the supply curve.

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO003 (marginal analysis -- the supply curve reflects rising marginal cost, Chapter 1), DEF-CHO002 (diminishing marginal returns -- explains why marginal cost rises, Chapter 1), AX-CHO001 (rational self-interest -- firms maximize profit, Chapter 1)*

Supply reasoning mirrors demand reasoning:

**Level 1 -- The Law of Supply**: When the price of a good rises, quantity supplied increases. When the price falls, quantity supplied decreases. This is a **movement along** the supply curve.

Why does the supply curve slope upward? Because of diminishing marginal returns (DEF-CHO002, Chapter 1). As a firm produces more output, each additional unit costs more to make (workers become less productive, machines run at full capacity, overtime wages kick in). Higher prices make these higher-cost units profitable to produce.

**Level 2 -- Supply Shifters**: The entire supply curve shifts when a non-price factor changes:

| Shifter | Supply Increases (shifts right) | Supply Decreases (shifts left) |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Input costs | Costs fall (cheaper materials) | Costs rise (oil price spike) |
| Technology | Better technology (more output per input) | Technology breakdown |
| Number of sellers | More firms enter market | Firms exit market |
| Expectations | Expect lower future prices (sell now) | Expect higher future prices (hold inventory) |
| Regulation | Less regulation | More regulation (higher compliance costs) |

**Real-world example**: When a drought hits California's Central Valley, the supply of almonds shifts left -- at every price, fewer almonds are available. The drought did not change the price of almonds directly; it changed a non-price factor (an input -- water). The supply shift then causes the price to rise.

---

### **DEF-MKT002: Supply Curve**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a set of price-quantity pairs representing sellers' costs of production, construct the supply curve and read it to determine quantity supplied at any given price, or the minimum price sellers need to produce any given quantity.

*Depends on: PRIM-MKT002 (supply reasoning -- the supply curve is the graphical representation of supply, Chapter 3)*

The supply curve is a graph with price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. It slopes upward (law of supply). Like the demand curve, it can be read two ways:

- **Horizontally**: "At a price of $3, firms will produce 800 units."
- **Vertically**: "To produce the 800th unit, the firm needs at least $3 to cover the marginal cost."

The vertical reading of the supply curve gives you the **marginal cost** of each unit. This will become important when we discuss market efficiency in Chapter 5.

**Real-world example**: The supply curve for housing in San Francisco is nearly vertical -- meaning quantity supplied barely increases even when prices rise dramatically. Why? Geography (the city is surrounded by water on three sides) and zoning regulations severely limit new construction. The supply curve's shape tells you that increased demand for San Francisco housing will mostly raise prices rather than generate new housing.

### Practice Questions: MKT.2

1. A new automated bottling machine reduces the cost of producing soft drinks by 20%. Is this a movement along the supply curve or a shift? In which direction?

2. The government imposes a new safety regulation on toy manufacturers, raising production costs. What happens to the supply curve for toys?

3. Oil prices rise from $70 to $110 per barrel. What happens to the supply of gasoline (for which oil is an input)?

4. Why does the supply curve slope upward? Connect your answer to diminishing marginal returns (DEF-CHO002, Chapter 1).

## MKT.3: Equilibrium -- Where the Market Settles

### The Invisible Hand

We now have two curves: demand (what buyers want at each price) and supply (what sellers offer at each price). Put them together, and something remarkable happens: a single price emerges that coordinates the plans of millions of independent buyers and sellers.

---

### **PRIM-MKT003: Equilibrium Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a supply curve and a demand curve for a market, find the price and quantity where the two curves intersect, then predict what happens when supply or demand shifts by tracing through to the new equilibrium.

*Depends on: PRIM-MKT001 (demand reasoning -- need the demand curve, Chapter 3), PRIM-MKT002 (supply reasoning -- need the supply curve, Chapter 3)*

The equilibrium price (P\*) and equilibrium quantity (Q\*) are found where the demand curve and supply curve intersect -- where Q_d = Q_s. At this point:

- Every buyer willing to pay at least P\* finds a seller.
- Every seller willing to accept at least P\* finds a buyer.
- There is no shortage and no surplus.

**What if the price is NOT at equilibrium?**

- **Price above P\* (too high)**: Sellers want to sell more than buyers want to buy. Surplus results (unsold inventory piles up). Sellers compete by lowering prices. Price falls toward P\*.
- **Price below P\* (too low)**: Buyers want to buy more than sellers want to sell. Shortage results (empty shelves, waiting lists). Buyers compete by offering higher prices. Price rises toward P\*.

The market is self-correcting. Surpluses push prices down; shortages push prices up. The equilibrium is the resting point -- the price at which the market naturally settles.

**Comparative statics**: The power of equilibrium reasoning is predicting what happens when something changes. The procedure is:

1. Identify the shock: does it affect demand, supply, or both?
2. Determine the direction of the shift (left or right).
3. Find the new equilibrium: where does the shifted curve intersect the unchanged curve (or, if both shift, where do the two new curves intersect)?
4. Compare old and new equilibrium: did P\* rise or fall? Did Q\* rise or fall?

| Shock | P\* | Q\* |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Demand increases (shifts right) | Rises | Rises |
| Demand decreases (shifts left) | Falls | Falls |
| Supply increases (shifts right) | Falls | Rises |
| Supply decreases (shifts left) | Rises | Falls |

When both curves shift simultaneously, you can predict the direction of one variable but not the other without knowing the relative magnitudes. For example, if demand increases AND supply increases, Q\* definitely rises, but P\* could go either way.

> **Reasoning Chain: How Prices Allocate Scarce Resources (CP-001)**
> 1. *PRIM-CHO001 (scarcity, Ch 1)*: Wheat, labor, oven space, and shelf space are all scarce. The bakery, the grocery store, and the consumer all face constraints.
> 2. *PRIM-CHO002 + PRIM-CHO003 (opportunity cost + marginal analysis, Ch 1)*: The bakery compares the marginal cost of producing one more loaf to the price it can sell it for. Consumers compare the marginal benefit of one more loaf to its price and their budget.
> 3. *PRIM-CHO004 (incentive reasoning, Ch 1)*: If bread prices rise due to a wheat shortage, consumers buy less and bakers produce more -- both responding to the price incentive.
> 4. *PRIM-MKT001 + PRIM-MKT002 (demand + supply, Ch 3)*: These individual decisions aggregate into demand and supply curves for bread.
> 5. *PRIM-MKT003 (equilibrium, Ch 3)*: The market price adjusts until quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. No central planner decided how much bread Minneapolis needs. The price did it.
>
> This is Adam Smith's "invisible hand": prices coordinate the self-interested decisions of millions of individuals into an organized allocation of scarce resources.

**Real-world example**: In 2021, a global semiconductor shortage (supply shifted left) coincided with surging demand for electronics as remote work became permanent (demand shifted right). Equilibrium reasoning predicts: price rises dramatically (both shifts push price up) and the effect on quantity is ambiguous (demand pushes Q up, supply pushes Q down). In reality, electronics prices soared while production struggled to keep up -- exactly what the model predicts.

## MKT.4: When Governments Set Prices

### Price Controls: Well-Intentioned, Often Counterproductive

Sometimes governments decide that the market equilibrium price is too high for buyers or too low for sellers. They step in and set a legal maximum or minimum price. These interventions are called **price controls**, and they have predictable -- often unintended -- consequences.

---

### **DEF-MKT003: Price Ceiling and Floor**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a government-imposed price that differs from market equilibrium, determine whether the result is a shortage (ceiling below equilibrium) or surplus (floor above equilibrium), and identify the efficiency consequences.

*Depends on: PRIM-MKT003 (equilibrium reasoning -- price controls are deviations from equilibrium, Chapter 3)*

**Price ceiling**: A legal MAXIMUM price. Cannot charge more than this amount.

- If the ceiling is BELOW equilibrium: it is **binding**. At the artificially low price, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied. Result: **shortage** -- long lines, rationing, waiting lists, or black markets.
- If the ceiling is ABOVE equilibrium: it is **non-binding** and has no effect (the market already sets a lower price).

**Price floor**: A legal MINIMUM price. Cannot charge less than this amount.

- If the floor is ABOVE equilibrium: it is **binding**. At the artificially high price, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded. Result: **surplus** -- unsold inventory, or in the case of labor markets, unemployment.
- If the floor is BELOW equilibrium: it is **non-binding** and has no effect.

**The pattern**: Binding price controls prevent the market from reaching equilibrium. They create either a shortage (ceiling) or a surplus (floor). In both cases, some mutually beneficial transactions that would have occurred at the equilibrium price do not occur -- creating inefficiency.

**Real-world example -- Rent control (price ceiling)**: Many cities cap rent increases to keep housing affordable. The intention is good: protect renters from rising costs. But equilibrium reasoning predicts the consequences: at below-market rents, more people want apartments (high Q_d) while landlords have less incentive to build new ones or maintain existing ones (low Q_s). Result: a housing shortage. Long waiting lists. Apartments in disrepair. A black market for sublets. New York City has had rent control since World War II and a chronic housing shortage for just as long.

**Real-world example -- Minimum wage (price floor)**: The minimum wage is a price floor in the labor market. If set above the equilibrium wage for low-skill workers, it creates a surplus of labor -- more people want to work at $15/hour than employers want to hire. Some workers benefit (those who keep their jobs at higher wages). Others lose (those who cannot find work because employers cut positions or automate). The net effect is an empirical question that depends on the elasticity of labor demand (Chapter 4).

## Chapter Summary

This chapter established the **market toolkit** -- the core reasoning moves for analyzing how prices coordinate the decisions of millions of independent buyers and sellers. Here is what you can now do:

| ID | Reasoning Move | What It Lets You Do |
|----|---------------|---------------------|
| PRIM-MKT001 | Demand reasoning | Predict how buyers respond to price changes and non-price factors |
| DEF-MKT001 | Demand curve | Read and interpret the graphical representation of buyer behavior |
| PRIM-MKT002 | Supply reasoning | Predict how sellers respond to price changes and non-price factors |
| DEF-MKT002 | Supply curve | Read and interpret the graphical representation of seller behavior |
| PRIM-MKT003 | Equilibrium reasoning | Find where markets clear and predict the effects of supply/demand shifts |
| DEF-MKT003 | Price ceiling and floor | Analyze the consequences of government price controls |

These six tools form the backbone of microeconomic analysis. Chapter 4 (Elasticity) will add a crucial quantitative dimension: knowing that quantity demanded falls when price rises is not enough -- you need to know **by how much**. Chapter 5 (Market Efficiency) will introduce consumer and producer surplus, giving you a way to measure whether markets are making people better or worse off. And Chapter 7 (Market Failures) will reveal the conditions under which the invisible hand falters and prices fail to coordinate efficiently.

But the supply-demand framework always comes first. Before you can ask how responsive buyers are to price changes, you need to understand why they respond at all. Before you can measure market efficiency, you need to know what equilibrium looks like. **How do prices coordinate decisions?** is the central question of this chapter, and the answer -- through the self-correcting interaction of supply and demand -- is the central mechanism of economics.
