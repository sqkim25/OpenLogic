# Chapter 1: Scarcity, Choice, and Tradeoffs

*Domain: CHO (Choice) -- The root of all economic reasoning*

---

You set your alarm for 6:30 AM. You have a full day ahead: classes, a shift at work, a friend's birthday dinner, and an exam to study for. But the day is only 24 hours long. You cannot attend every class, work a full shift, study for three hours, exercise, AND go to the birthday dinner. Something has to give.

This is not a time-management problem. It is an economics problem -- the most fundamental economics problem there is. You have limited resources (time, energy, money) and unlimited wants (sleep, grades, income, social life, fitness). The gap between what you want and what you can have is called **scarcity**, and it is the reason economics exists as a field of study.

This chapter introduces the foundational reasoning moves that economists use to analyze any decision -- from what to eat for lunch to whether a country should build fighter jets or hospitals. By the end, you will have nine tools in your toolkit. Every chapter in the rest of this book builds on these nine.

We start with the concept that makes all the others necessary.

## CHO.1: Scarcity and Rational Self-Interest

### Why Can't You Have Everything?

Walk through a grocery store. The shelves are full. The variety is staggering. It looks like a world of abundance, not scarcity. So where is the scarcity?

It is in your wallet. The store has thousands of products, but you have $80 for the week. You cannot buy everything you want. You must choose. That constraint -- finite budget, unlimited desires -- is scarcity at work.

Scarcity is not the same as poverty. A billionaire faces scarcity too: they have 24 hours in a day, just like you. A wealthy country faces scarcity: it has finite workers, finite land, finite oil, and cannot produce unlimited amounts of everything. Scarcity means that resources have **alternative uses** -- every dollar spent on one thing is a dollar not spent on another; every hour used for one activity is an hour not available for another.

---

### **PRIM-CHO001: Scarcity Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a description of wants and available resources, determine whether the wants exceed the resources, and if so, identify the constraint that forces a tradeoff.

This is the entry point to all economic reasoning. Before you can ask "what should I choose?" you must recognize that a choice is necessary -- that you cannot have it all. Scarcity reasoning is the act of looking at wants, looking at resources, identifying the gap, and recognizing that satisfying one want means leaving another unmet.

**The scarcity test**: Take any situation and ask: (1) What are the wants? (2) What are the available resources? (3) Do the wants exceed the resources? If yes, scarcity exists, and someone must choose.

**Real-world example**: The US federal budget is roughly $6 trillion per year. That sounds like an enormous amount of money, and it is. But the total cost of everything the government could potentially fund -- universal healthcare, a larger military, infrastructure repair, space exploration, climate change mitigation, education, scientific research -- far exceeds $6 trillion. Congress must choose. That is scarcity at the national level.

**Real-world example**: You have a three-day weekend. You want to visit a friend in another city, catch up on two assignments, binge a TV series, deep-clean your apartment, and sleep in. You cannot do all of them well. The scarce resource is time, and the forced tradeoff is real.

---

### **AX-CHO001: Rational Self-Interest**

> **Axiom**: Economic agents (consumers, firms, governments) generally act to maximize their own perceived well-being, given their information and constraints.

Before we go further, we need a behavioral assumption: when people face scarce resources and must choose, HOW do they choose? Economics assumes they choose in their own self-interest -- they pick the option they believe makes them best off.

This is NOT the same as saying people are selfish. A parent who sacrifices sleep to care for a sick child is acting in their self-interest if the child's well-being is part of what makes the parent feel fulfilled. A donor who gives to charity is acting in their self-interest if generosity brings them satisfaction. Rational self-interest means that people respond **predictably** to incentives: when the cost of something rises, they do less of it; when the reward rises, they do more.

This axiom is a simplification. Real people sometimes make impulsive decisions, follow peer pressure, or misunderstand their options. Behavioral economics documents these deviations carefully. But as a starting model, rational self-interest is remarkably powerful: it predicts that when gas prices rise, people drive less; when wages for nurses rise during a shortage, more students choose nursing programs; when a store runs a sale, it sells more. These are not controversial predictions -- they follow directly from the assumption that people respond to incentives.

We will treat rational self-interest as the default model while acknowledging that it has limits. The model is not a description of how people always behave -- it is a reasoning tool that generates useful predictions about how they will typically behave.

### Practice Questions: CHO.1

1. A city has a budget of $50 million for new infrastructure. It can build a new library ($20M), repave roads ($15M), or build a community health clinic ($25M). Does scarcity exist here? What is the scarce resource? Can the city do all three?

2. Is scarcity eliminated in a wealthy country like Norway or Singapore? Why or why not?

3. A college student decides to skip a party to study for a final exam. Is this consistent with the rational self-interest axiom? Why?

4. Give an example of scarcity from your own life that involves a scarce resource other than money.

---

## CHO.2: Opportunity Cost

### The Hidden Price Tag

You got into two colleges. College A has a strong program in your field and costs $15,000 per year in tuition. College B is less prestigious but offered you a full scholarship. You chose College A.

What is the cost of attending College A? If you answered "$15,000 per year," you are only partly right. The full cost includes something you did not pay: the free education you gave up at College B. And it includes something even bigger: the four years of income you could have earned if you had entered the workforce instead of attending college.

This is **opportunity cost** -- the most important concept in economics.

---

### **PRIM-CHO002: Opportunity Cost Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a decision between two or more alternatives, identify the value of the best forgone alternative to determine the true cost of the chosen option.

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO001 (scarcity reasoning -- opportunity cost exists because resources are scarce, Chapter 1)*

Every choice has a visible cost (the money you spend, the time you use) and a hidden cost (the value of the best thing you gave up). Opportunity cost captures the hidden part. The total economic cost of any decision is:

> Total cost = Explicit cost (what you pay) + Opportunity cost (value of best forgone alternative)

This formula transforms how you evaluate decisions. It means:

- The cost of going to a movie is not just the $15 ticket -- it is also the three hours you could have spent studying, working, or sleeping.
- The cost of holding $10,000 in a savings account earning 1% interest is not zero -- it is the 8% return you could have earned investing it in an index fund. The opportunity cost is $700 per year.
- The cost of a city building a sports stadium is not just the $500 million in construction costs -- it is the hospital, school, or transit system that $500 million could have built instead.

Research shows that even trained economists sometimes fail to correctly identify opportunity cost in unfamiliar settings. It is a genuine threshold concept: once you learn to see opportunity costs, you cannot unsee them. Every decision you make for the rest of your life will be filtered through this lens.

**Real-world example**: Why do more people enroll in graduate school during recessions? Because when jobs are scarce and wages are low, the opportunity cost of being in school is lower. You are giving up a low-paying (or nonexistent) job instead of a good one. When the economy is booming and jobs pay well, the opportunity cost of grad school is higher, and enrollment drops.

---

### Practice Questions: CHO.2

1. You have a free Saturday. You could (a) work a shift at your part-time job earning $120, (b) go to a concert with friends (ticket costs $50), or (c) study for an exam. You choose to study. What is the opportunity cost of studying? (Hint: it is the value of the BEST forgone alternative, not the sum of all alternatives.)

2. A farmer owns 100 acres of land. She can plant wheat (earning $200/acre) or soybeans (earning $180/acre). She plants wheat. What is the opportunity cost per acre of planting wheat?

3. The government spends $2 billion on a new highway. A politician says "this highway is free -- we are using existing tax revenue." Is the highway really free? What is the opportunity cost?

---

## CHO.3: Thinking at the Margin

### Not "Whether" but "How Much"

Most economic decisions are not all-or-nothing. You do not decide "should I study or not?" You decide "should I study for one MORE hour?" You do not decide "should I eat or not?" You decide "should I eat one MORE slice of pizza?" Economics is about decisions at the edge -- the margin.

---

### **PRIM-CHO003: Marginal Analysis**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a decision about how much of something to do (not whether to do it), compare the additional benefit of one more unit to the additional cost of one more unit to determine the optimal quantity.

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO001 (scarcity reasoning -- marginal analysis is needed because scarce resources force optimization, Chapter 1)*

The word "marginal" in economics means "one more" or "additional." Marginal analysis asks a simple question: **Is one more unit worth it?**

- **Marginal benefit (MB)**: the additional benefit from one more unit of an activity.
- **Marginal cost (MC)**: the additional cost from one more unit of an activity.
- **The rule**: If MB > MC, do more. If MB < MC, do less. The optimal amount is where MB = MC.

This is the operational core of rational decision-making. It works because of a crucial pattern: marginal benefit usually **decreases** while marginal cost usually **increases**.

Think about eating pizza. The first slice is delicious -- high marginal benefit. The second is good. The third is okay. By the fifth, you are feeling sick -- the marginal benefit has dropped near zero (or gone negative). Meanwhile, the marginal cost stays roughly constant (each slice costs the same). At some point, the marginal benefit of another slice drops below its marginal cost. That is when you stop.

The same logic applies everywhere:

- **A student studying**: The first hour of studying for an exam has high marginal benefit (you learn the key concepts). The fifth hour has lower marginal benefit (you are reviewing material you already know). The marginal cost (exhaustion, lost sleep) rises. The optimal study time is where the additional grade improvement from one more hour just equals the cost of that hour.

- **A firm hiring workers**: The first worker hired produces a lot (high marginal benefit to the firm). The tenth worker in the same small workspace adds less. The firm keeps hiring as long as the revenue from one more worker's output exceeds the cost of hiring them.

- **A government investing in infrastructure**: The first bridge connecting two cities has enormous benefit. The third bridge between the same two cities has much less. Marginal analysis tells the government when to stop building.

**Real-world example**: Should a coffee shop stay open one more hour at night? The marginal benefit is the revenue from late-night customers. The marginal cost is the wages paid to staff, plus electricity, plus wear and tear. If only two customers show up in that extra hour and spend $8 total, but the staff costs $25/hour, the marginal cost exceeds the marginal benefit. Close earlier.

---

### Practice Questions: CHO.3

1. You are deciding how many hours to work per week at a part-time job. Each hour pays $15. But each additional hour of work means one less hour for studying, and your grades start to suffer after 15 hours of work per week. Describe how marginal analysis would help you decide the optimal number of hours.

2. A bakery is deciding how many loaves of bread to bake tomorrow. Each loaf costs $2 to make and sells for $5. But after 100 loaves, the bakery runs out of oven space and has to rent a second oven for $50. Should the bakery bake 101 loaves? What additional information would you need?

3. Why does marginal analysis focus on "one more unit" rather than the total amount? Why not just ask "is studying worth it?" rather than "is one more hour of studying worth it?"

---

## CHO.4: Incentives

### Changed Costs, Changed Behavior

In 2002, Ireland introduced a 15-cent tax on plastic bags. Within weeks, plastic bag usage dropped by 94%. The bags did not become illegal. Nobody was forced to stop using them. The tax simply changed the cost -- and people responded.

This is incentive reasoning: when the costs or benefits of a behavior change, behavior changes predictably.

---

### **PRIM-CHO004: Incentive Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a change in costs, benefits, rules, or rewards facing a decision-maker, predict how the decision-maker's behavior will change in response to the altered incentives.

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO001 (scarcity reasoning -- incentives matter because agents face constraints, Chapter 1), PRIM-CHO003 (marginal analysis -- incentive changes shift marginal benefit or marginal cost, Chapter 1)*

Incentive reasoning is the bridge between individual choice and systemic outcomes. It says: if you want to predict what people will do, look at the incentives they face. If you want to change what people do, change the incentives.

The logic is straightforward:

- When the **cost** of an activity rises, people do **less** of it.
- When the **reward** for an activity rises, people do **more** of it.
- When the rules change, people adjust their behavior to the new rules -- sometimes in ways the rule-maker did not anticipate.

That last point is crucial. Incentive reasoning reveals **unintended consequences**. A policy designed to achieve goal X may, through incentive effects, actually produce the opposite of X.

**Real-world example**: Some cities have offered bounties for killing rats. In one famous case (Hanoi, French colonial era), the government paid residents for each rat tail turned in. Result: people started breeding rats for the bounty. The incentive to kill rats was overwhelmed by the incentive to produce rat tails. The rat population grew.

**Real-world example**: When ride-sharing apps introduced "surge pricing" (higher prices during peak demand), many passengers were outraged. But surge pricing is a textbook incentive mechanism: higher prices discourage marginal riders (who can wait) and attract more drivers (who earn more during surges). The result is shorter wait times for those who really need a ride. The changed price incentive coordinates behavior without any central command.

**Real-world example**: Seat belt laws save lives. But when researchers studied the data, they found a nuance: drivers wearing seat belts drove slightly more aggressively (they felt safer). The number of driver deaths fell, but the number of pedestrian deaths rose slightly. Incentive reasoning predicts this: making driving safer reduces the marginal cost of aggressive driving, so drivers take more risks.

---

### Practice Questions: CHO.4

1. A company offers a $500 bonus to employees who bike to work instead of driving. Using incentive reasoning, predict two behavioral changes this might cause -- one intended and one unintended.

2. A university eliminates the penalty for dropping a class after the midterm. How would incentive reasoning predict this affects student enrollment behavior?

3. Gas prices rise from $3.00 to $5.00 per gallon. Using incentive reasoning, predict three ways consumers might change their behavior.

## CHO.5: The Production Possibilities Frontier

### Seeing Tradeoffs on a Map

We have established that scarcity forces tradeoffs and that every choice has an opportunity cost. Now we need a tool to visualize these ideas. That tool is the **production possibilities frontier** (PPF).

---

### **DEF-CHO001: Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a fixed set of resources and two possible outputs, construct or interpret the PPF curve to identify feasible, infeasible, and efficient production combinations, and to visualize opportunity cost as the slope of the frontier.

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO001 (scarcity reasoning -- the PPF exists because resources are finite, Chapter 1), PRIM-CHO002 (opportunity cost reasoning -- the PPF's slope is the visual representation of opportunity cost, Chapter 1)*

Imagine a small country that can produce only two things: food and clothing. It has a fixed number of workers and a fixed amount of farmland and factory space. If it puts all workers in agriculture, it produces 1,000 tons of food and zero clothing. If it puts all workers in factories, it produces 500 units of clothing and zero food. And there are many combinations in between.

The PPF is the curve connecting all the maximum possible combinations. It shows three things:

1. **Points ON the frontier**: Efficient -- all resources are being used. The country is producing as much as it can.
2. **Points INSIDE the frontier**: Feasible but inefficient -- some resources are idle or wasted. The country could produce more without giving anything up.
3. **Points OUTSIDE the frontier**: Infeasible -- the country does not have enough resources to produce this combination.

**The slope of the PPF is the opportunity cost**. Moving along the frontier from one combination to another, the slope tells you how many units of one good you must give up to produce one more unit of the other. This is opportunity cost made visible.

Why is the PPF typically bowed outward (concave)? Because of **diminishing marginal returns**: resources are not equally suited to producing both goods. The first workers shifted from clothing to food production are the ones best suited for farming -- they produce a lot of food for little clothing given up. The last workers shifted are factory specialists forced into agriculture -- they produce little extra food but the country gives up a lot of clothing. The opportunity cost of food rises as you produce more of it.

---

### **DEF-CHO002: Diminishing Marginal Returns**

> **Reasoning move**: Given a production process where one input is being increased while others are held fixed, recognize that beyond some point, each additional unit of the variable input adds less additional output than the previous unit.

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO003 (marginal analysis -- diminishing marginal returns is about the marginal product declining, Chapter 1)*

Diminishing marginal returns explains why the PPF is bowed and why supply curves slope upward (a preview of Chapter 3). The idea is simple: if you keep adding more of one input while holding everything else fixed, eventually the additional output from each extra unit gets smaller.

**Real-world example**: A small coffee shop has one espresso machine. The first barista makes 30 drinks per hour. Adding a second barista (who can take orders while the first pulls shots) increases output to 50 drinks per hour -- the second worker added 20 drinks. A third barista adds 10 more. A fourth, squeezed behind the counter, adds 3. A fifth would just be in the way. Each additional barista contributes less because the fixed input (one espresso machine, limited counter space) becomes a bottleneck.

The key insight: total output still rises (the shop makes more drinks with each additional worker), but the **rate** of increase falls. This is not because later workers are lazier -- it is because the fixed resource is being stretched thinner.

---

### Practice Questions: CHO.5

1. A country produces guns and butter. Currently it makes 100 guns and 200 tons of butter, and it is on its PPF. To produce 10 more guns, it must give up 30 tons of butter. What is the opportunity cost of one gun (in terms of butter)?

2. Why does a country operating INSIDE its PPF have a problem? What might cause a country to operate inside its PPF?

3. A technological improvement in agriculture allows farmers to produce more food with the same resources. What happens to the PPF? Does it shift outward everywhere, or only on the food axis?

4. Explain why adding a fifth cook to a small restaurant kitchen might not increase the number of meals produced very much, even though the cook works just as hard as the others.

---

## CHO.6: Specialization and Comparative Advantage

### Why the Surgeon Hires a Typist

Here is a puzzle. Suppose a surgeon can type 120 words per minute -- faster than her secretary, who types 80 words per minute. The surgeon is better at BOTH surgery and typing. Why does she hire a secretary to type at all? Why not do it herself and save the salary?

The answer is one of the most powerful ideas in all of economics: **comparative advantage**.

---

### **PRIM-CHO005: Trade and Specialization Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given two agents (people, firms, or countries) with different abilities to produce goods, determine who should specialize in what and whether trade can make both better off, even if one agent is better at producing everything.

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO002 (opportunity cost reasoning -- comparative advantage is defined in terms of opportunity cost, Chapter 1)*

The surgeon CAN type faster than her secretary. She has an **absolute advantage** in both surgery and typing. But every hour the surgeon spends typing is an hour she is NOT performing surgery. If surgery earns $500 per hour and typing could be done by a secretary for $25 per hour, the surgeon's opportunity cost of typing is enormous: she gives up $500 to do a job that costs $25 to delegate.

The surgeon's **comparative advantage** is in surgery -- not because she is better at surgery (though she is), but because her opportunity cost of surgery relative to typing is lower than the secretary's. The secretary's comparative advantage is in typing -- not because the secretary types faster (she does not), but because her opportunity cost of typing is much lower than the surgeon's.

When each person specializes in the activity where their opportunity cost is lowest and they trade for the rest, **both are better off**. The surgeon earns more (spending all her time on high-value surgery). The secretary earns a salary (doing work the surgeon would overpay to do herself). Total output increases.

This is not just a clever story about surgeons. It is the foundational argument for why trade -- between people, between firms, between countries -- makes both sides better off. And it leads directly to a formal procedure for determining who should specialize in what.

---

### **DEF-CHO003: Comparative Advantage**

> **Reasoning move**: Given production data for two agents and two goods, compute each agent's opportunity cost of producing each good, then identify which agent has the lower opportunity cost for each good to determine who should specialize in what.

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO002 (opportunity cost reasoning, Chapter 1), PRIM-CHO005 (trade and specialization reasoning, Chapter 1)*

Here is the step-by-step procedure:

**Step 1**: For each agent, calculate the opportunity cost of producing each good.
**Step 2**: Compare opportunity costs. The agent with the LOWER opportunity cost of a good has the comparative advantage in that good.
**Step 3**: Each agent specializes in the good where they have comparative advantage.
**Step 4**: They trade at a price between their two opportunity costs, and both end up with more than if they had produced everything themselves.

**Worked example**: The US and Colombia both produce roses and software.

| | Roses (per worker-year) | Software (per worker-year) |
|---|---|---|
| US | 10,000 stems | 50 programs |
| Colombia | 20,000 stems | 10 programs |

The US has absolute advantage in software (50 > 10). Colombia has absolute advantage in roses (20,000 > 10,000). But absolute advantage does not tell us who should specialize. Opportunity cost does.

- **US opportunity cost of 1 program of software**: 10,000/50 = 200 stems of roses given up.
- **Colombia opportunity cost of 1 program of software**: 20,000/10 = 2,000 stems of roses given up.
- **US opportunity cost of 1 stem of roses**: 50/10,000 = 0.005 programs given up.
- **Colombia opportunity cost of 1 stem of roses**: 10/20,000 = 0.0005 programs given up.

The US has comparative advantage in software (gives up only 200 roses per program vs. Colombia's 2,000). Colombia has comparative advantage in roses (gives up only 0.0005 programs per rose vs. the US's 0.005).

If each country specializes and trades, both get more roses AND more software than they could produce alone. This is why your Valentine's Day roses were likely grown in Colombia and your laptop's software was likely written in the US.

> **Reasoning Chain: Why Trade Makes Both Sides Better Off (CP-002, partial)**
> 1. *PRIM-CHO001 (scarcity)*: Both countries have limited workers. Neither can produce unlimited roses AND software.
> 2. *PRIM-CHO002 (opportunity cost)*: Each country's opportunity cost of producing each good is different, reflecting different resource endowments.
> 3. *PRIM-CHO005 (trade and specialization)*: Rather than each producing both goods, each country should specialize in what it does at lower opportunity cost.
> 4. *DEF-CHO003 (comparative advantage)*: The US specializes in software (OC = 200 roses); Colombia specializes in roses (OC = 0.0005 programs). Both specialize where their OC is lower.
> 5. *Result*: Trade at any price between the two opportunity costs makes both countries better off. Total world output of both goods increases.
>
> *Note*: The GDP impact of this trade pattern is formalized in Chapter 10 (PRIM-MAC001), completing the full CP-002 reasoning chain.

**Real-world example**: Bangladesh exports more clothing than almost any country on earth. It is not because Bangladesh has the most advanced textile factories (it does not). It is because Bangladesh's opportunity cost of producing clothing is very low -- the alternative uses of its large, low-wage labor force generate less value. Meanwhile, Germany specializes in precision engineering because its highly trained workforce would be wasted on basic textile production. Both countries are better off trading than trying to produce everything domestically.

### Practice Questions: CHO.6

1. Alice can mow a lawn in 1 hour or clean a house in 3 hours. Bob can mow a lawn in 2 hours or clean a house in 2 hours. (a) Who has the absolute advantage in mowing? In cleaning? (b) What is each person's opportunity cost of mowing one lawn? (c) Who has the comparative advantage in mowing? In cleaning? (d) If they specialize and trade, how do both benefit?

2. Japan is better than Thailand at producing both cars and rice. Does this mean Japan should produce both and not trade with Thailand? Why or why not?

3. A student is better at both math and writing than their roommate. The student's economics homework involves both quantitative problems and essay questions. Using comparative advantage reasoning, explain how they might divide the work.

4. Politicians sometimes argue that a country should "make everything at home" and not depend on imports. Use comparative advantage to evaluate this claim.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter established the **choice toolkit** -- the foundational reasoning moves for analyzing any economic decision. Here is what you can now do:

| ID | Reasoning Move | What It Lets You Do |
|----|---------------|---------------------|
| PRIM-CHO001 | Scarcity reasoning | Identify when wants exceed resources and a tradeoff is forced |
| AX-CHO001 | Rational self-interest | Predict that agents respond systematically to incentives |
| PRIM-CHO002 | Opportunity cost reasoning | Calculate the true cost of any choice, including hidden costs |
| PRIM-CHO003 | Marginal analysis | Determine the optimal quantity by comparing one-more-unit benefit to one-more-unit cost |
| PRIM-CHO004 | Incentive reasoning | Predict behavioral changes from changed costs, rewards, or rules |
| DEF-CHO001 | Production possibilities frontier | Visualize scarcity, efficiency, and opportunity cost on a single diagram |
| DEF-CHO002 | Diminishing marginal returns | Recognize that adding more of one input (holding others fixed) eventually yields smaller gains |
| PRIM-CHO005 | Trade and specialization | Determine who should produce what and why trade makes both sides better off |
| DEF-CHO003 | Comparative advantage | Compute opportunity costs to identify optimal specialization patterns |

Every concept in the rest of this book builds on these 9 items. Chapter 3 (Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium) will take the individual decision logic you learned here -- marginal analysis, incentive reasoning, diminishing marginal returns -- and show what happens when millions of individuals make decisions simultaneously in a market. The result is a coordination mechanism that no single person controls: the price system.

But choice always comes first. Before you ask how markets work, you must understand why people make the choices they do. Before you ask how the economy behaves in aggregate, you must understand the individual decision logic that drives it. **How do individuals and firms decide?** is the root question. Everything else grows from the answer.
