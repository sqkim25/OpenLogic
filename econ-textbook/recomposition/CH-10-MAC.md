# Chapter 10: Measuring the Macroeconomy

*Domain: MAC (Macroeconomics) -- How the economy behaves in aggregate*

---

You check the news and see three headlines:

- "GDP Grew 2.1% Last Quarter"
- "Unemployment Falls to 3.7%"
- "Inflation Hits 6.5%, Highest in 40 Years"

You have been reading these headlines your entire life. But what do they actually mean? What is GDP measuring -- and what does it miss? When the unemployment rate falls, is that always good news? When prices rise, who wins and who loses?

Until now, this book has focused on individual decisions (Chapter 1) and individual markets (Chapters 3--7). One consumer buying avocados. One firm in the coffee market. One industry's supply and demand. Those are micro questions -- questions about specific agents and specific markets.

This chapter makes a different kind of move. We zoom out from individual markets to the **entire economy** and ask: How much stuff did the country produce? How many people cannot find jobs? Are prices rising across the board? These are macro questions -- questions about the economy in aggregate. They require new measurement tools because aggregate outcomes can behave differently from individual market outcomes. A drought that raises the price of lettuce is a micro phenomenon (one market). A 9% increase in the prices of nearly everything is a macro phenomenon (economy-wide forces at work).

This chapter introduces five measurement tools that economists and policymakers use to diagnose the economy's health: GDP, the nominal-vs-real distinction, unemployment, inflation, and the price level. These are the vital signs of the macroeconomy -- the numbers behind the headlines.

## MAC.1: GDP -- The Economy's Report Card

### What Did the Country Produce?

If you wanted to know how a business was doing, you would look at its total revenue. If you wanted to know how a country's economy is doing, you would look at its **gross domestic product** (GDP) -- the broadest measure of what the economy produced.

---

### **PRIM-MAC001: GDP Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given data about an economy's output over a time period, determine what is and is not counted in GDP to assess the economy's total production, and distinguish between GDP growth (more output) and mere price increases (inflation).

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO001 (scarcity reasoning -- GDP measures the economy's total output from scarce resources, Chapter 1)*

GDP is the total market value of all **final** goods and services produced within a country in a given time period (usually a quarter or a year). That sentence is packed with important qualifications. Let us unpack them.

**"Market value"**: GDP adds up everything by converting output into dollar values. A ton of wheat and a laptop are very different things, but they both have a market price. GDP adds them in dollar terms.

**"Final goods and services"**: GDP counts only finished products sold to end users, not intermediate goods used to produce something else. The flour sold to a bakery is an intermediate good -- it becomes part of bread. If we counted both the flour AND the bread, we would be double-counting. GDP counts the bread.

**"Produced within a country"**: GDP measures output based on geography, not nationality. A Japanese-owned factory in Ohio contributes to US GDP. An American-owned factory in Mexico does not.

**"In a given time period"**: GDP is a flow, not a stock. It measures what was produced this quarter, not the total wealth that has accumulated over decades.

### The Expenditure Approach: C + I + G + NX

The most common way to measure GDP is by adding up all spending on final goods and services. Every dollar spent on final output is someone's income, so total spending equals total output:

> **GDP = C + I + G + NX**

| Component | What It Measures | Examples | Share of US GDP (approx.) |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|--------------------------|
| **C** (Consumption) | Household spending on goods and services | Groceries, rent, haircuts, Netflix | ~68% |
| **I** (Investment) | Business spending on capital + new housing | Factory equipment, software, new homes | ~18% |
| **G** (Government) | Government purchases of goods and services | Military equipment, teacher salaries, roads | ~17% |
| **NX** (Net exports) | Exports minus imports | Cars sold abroad minus cars bought from abroad | ~ -3% |

A few common confusions:

- **Investment does NOT mean buying stocks or bonds.** In GDP, "investment" means businesses buying physical capital (machines, buildings) or software. Buying a share of Apple stock is a financial transaction, not production.
- **Government spending in GDP does NOT include transfer payments.** Social Security checks, unemployment benefits, and food stamps are transfers -- the government takes money from taxpayers and gives it to recipients. They are not purchases of goods and services. (Transfer payments show up in C when the recipients spend them.)
- **Imports are subtracted.** When you buy a Japanese-made TV, your spending shows up in C (you bought a consumer good). But the TV was not produced in the US. NX subtracts it so it does not inflate US GDP.

### What GDP Does NOT Count

GDP is powerful but limited. It does not count:

- **Household production**: Cooking dinner, cleaning your own house, raising your own children. If you hire someone to do these things, it counts; if you do them yourself, it does not.
- **Underground economy**: Cash-only businesses, illegal transactions, unreported work.
- **Leisure**: GDP does not value your free time. A country that works 80-hour weeks may have higher GDP than one that works 35-hour weeks, but that does not mean its citizens are better off.
- **Environmental quality**: GDP counts the output of a factory but not the pollution it creates. It counts the cost of cleaning up an oil spill (that is a service someone was paid to provide) but not the damage the spill caused.
- **Distribution**: GDP tells you the total size of the pie, not how the slices are divided. Two countries with the same GDP per capita could have very different levels of inequality.

Despite these limitations, GDP remains the best single measure of economic output. When GDP grows, it generally means more goods and services are available. When GDP shrinks, it generally means economic distress. The caveats matter, but the thermometer is still worth reading.

**Real-world example**: When the news reports "the economy grew 2.1% last quarter," it means real GDP increased by 2.1% compared to the previous quarter (annualized). That growth represents actual increases in the production of goods and services -- more cars built, more meals served, more software written. When the economy contracted 31.4% (annualized) in Q2 2020 during COVID-19 lockdowns, it meant a massive reduction in actual production: factories shut down, restaurants closed, flights were canceled.

### Practice Questions: MAC.1

1. A homeowner hires a company to paint their house for $3,000. Does this count in GDP? What if the homeowner paints the house themselves?

2. The US imports $500 billion in goods from China and exports $150 billion to China. What is NX for this bilateral relationship? How does it affect US GDP?

3. The government sends $1,400 stimulus checks to citizens. Does this directly increase the G component of GDP? Why or why not? (Hint: when do stimulus checks show up in GDP?)

4. Why is GDP described as an imperfect measure of well-being? Give two specific limitations.

## MAC.2: Nominal vs. Real -- Stripping Out Inflation

### The $20,000 House

Your grandparents bought their house in 1975 for $20,000. Today, a similar house in the same neighborhood costs $350,000. Did house prices really increase 17-fold? Or is something else going on?

Something else is going on. A dollar in 1975 bought much more than a dollar buys today. Adjusting for inflation, $20,000 in 1975 has the purchasing power of roughly $115,000 in 2024. The house price did increase in real terms -- but by roughly 3x, not 17x. The rest of the apparent increase is just the dollar losing value.

This is the nominal-vs-real distinction, and without it, almost every economic comparison across time is misleading.

---

### **DEF-MAC001: Nominal vs. Real Values**

> **Reasoning move**: Given an economic quantity measured in current dollars (nominal), adjust it for inflation to obtain the real value, which measures actual purchasing power or physical output.

*Depends on: PRIM-MAC001 (GDP reasoning -- nominal vs. real is essential for interpreting GDP data, Chapter 10), PRIM-MAC003 (inflation reasoning -- inflation is the wedge between nominal and real values, Chapter 10)*

**Nominal value**: Measured in current-period prices. Not adjusted for inflation. A $50,000 salary in 2024 is a nominal value.

**Real value**: Adjusted for inflation. Measured in the purchasing power of a chosen base year. A $50,000 salary in 2024, converted to 2010 dollars, might be worth $38,000 in real terms -- that is its actual purchasing power compared to 2010.

**The conversion formula**:

> Real value = Nominal value / (Price index / 100)

Or equivalently:

> Real value = Nominal value x (Price level in base year / Price level in current year)

**Why this matters**: Nominal GDP can increase for two reasons: (1) the country produced more stuff (real growth), or (2) the prices of existing stuff went up (inflation). If nominal GDP rises 5% but prices rose 3%, the real GDP growth was only about 2%. Without the nominal-real distinction, you cannot tell whether the economy actually produced more or just charged more.

The same logic applies to wages. If your salary rises 4% but inflation is 6%, your **real wage** fell by about 2%. You are earning more dollars, but each dollar buys less. You are worse off in real terms despite the nominal raise.

**Key applications**:

| Concept | Nominal Version | Real Version |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| GDP | Total output at current prices | Total output at base-year prices (measures actual production changes) |
| Wages | Dollars per hour in current year | Purchasing power per hour (adjusted for CPI) |
| Interest rate | The rate the bank quotes you | Nominal rate minus inflation rate (the Fisher equation) |

**Real-world example**: US nominal GDP in 2022 was about $25.5 trillion. In 2012, it was about $16.2 trillion. That looks like 57% growth. But prices also rose significantly over that decade. Adjusted to 2012 dollars, real GDP in 2022 was about $20.0 trillion -- representing roughly 23% real growth. Still impressive, but less than half of the apparent nominal growth. The rest was inflation.

---

### Practice Questions: MAC.2

1. Your salary is $45,000 in 2020 and $48,000 in 2024. Over that period, the CPI rose from 260 to 310. Did your real wage increase or decrease? By how much?

2. Nominal GDP rises from $20 trillion to $22 trillion in one year. Inflation during that year was 5%. Approximately how much did real GDP grow?

3. A savings account pays 3% interest. Inflation is 4%. What is the real interest rate? Are you gaining or losing purchasing power?

4. Why would comparing nominal GDP across countries be misleading? (Think about price level differences between, say, the US and India.)

## MAC.3: Unemployment -- Who Is Not Working and Why

### Behind the Headline Number

"Unemployment fell to 3.7%." That headline sounds straightforward, but it conceals important details. Who counts as "unemployed"? What about people who gave up looking? What about part-time workers who want full-time jobs? And is low unemployment always good?

---

### **PRIM-MAC002: Unemployment Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given labor market data, calculate the unemployment rate, distinguish between types of unemployment (frictional, structural, cyclical), and assess whether unemployment is above or below its natural rate.

*Depends on: PRIM-CHO001 (scarcity reasoning -- labor is a scarce resource; unemployment represents underutilization of that resource, Chapter 1)*

**The basics**: The labor force includes everyone who is either **employed** (has a job) or **unemployed** (does not have a job but is actively looking for one). People not in the labor force include retirees, full-time students, stay-at-home parents, and discouraged workers (who want work but have given up looking).

> Unemployment rate = (Number of unemployed / Labor force) x 100%

A worker counts as "unemployed" only if they are (1) without a job, (2) available for work, and (3) actively seeking work in the past four weeks. This definition matters: it means the official unemployment rate UNDERSTATES the true slack in the labor market because it excludes discouraged workers and people working part-time who want full-time work.

**Three types of unemployment**:

| Type | Cause | Duration | Example | Is It a Problem? |
|------|-------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Frictional** | Job transitions, search time | Short-term | A college graduate looking for their first job; a worker who quit to find a better position | No -- normal and healthy. Shows a dynamic labor market. |
| **Structural** | Mismatch between workers' skills and available jobs | Long-term | Coal miners in a region where mines are closing; factory workers replaced by automation | Yes -- requires retraining or relocation. Painful for individuals. |
| **Cyclical** | Economic downturns (recessions) | Varies with business cycle | Workers laid off during the 2020 COVID recession | Yes -- this is what macroeconomic policy tries to fix. |

**The natural rate of unemployment**: The rate when cyclical unemployment is zero -- it includes only frictional and structural components. In the US, the natural rate is estimated at roughly 4--5%. When actual unemployment is above the natural rate, the economy has slack (not producing at full capacity). When below, the economy may be overheating (too much demand for workers, which can fuel inflation).

**Real-world example**: In April 2020, US unemployment spiked to 14.7% -- almost entirely cyclical (COVID-19 shutdowns). By late 2022, it had fallen to 3.5%, well below the natural rate. Employers could not find enough workers; wages were rising rapidly. Both extremes illustrate unemployment reasoning: too-high unemployment means wasted resources; too-low unemployment can fuel inflation.

**Real-world example**: A coal miner in West Virginia loses her job because the local mine closes permanently. She has been mining for 20 years and has no other marketable skills. She is not between jobs (frictional) and is not laid off due to a recession (cyclical) -- the mine is never coming back. This is structural unemployment. It requires a fundamentally different response than cyclical unemployment: retraining programs, relocation assistance, or investment in new industries for the region.

### Practice Questions: MAC.3

1. In a country of 200 million adults: 130 million are employed, 10 million are unemployed and looking for work, and 60 million are not in the labor force. (a) What is the labor force? (b) What is the unemployment rate?

2. A recent college graduate spends three months searching for a job. What type of unemployment is this? Is it a problem for the economy?

3. The unemployment rate falls from 5% to 4%. A politician celebrates: "We created jobs!" But the labor force also shrank (some workers stopped looking). Is the politician's claim necessarily correct?

4. Distinguish between cyclical and structural unemployment. Why does the distinction matter for policy?

## MAC.4: Inflation and the Price Level

### When Everything Gets More Expensive

In June 2022, the US inflation rate hit 9.1% -- the highest in 40 years. Groceries, gas, rent, used cars, airline tickets: almost everything cost more. Your weekly grocery bill went from $80 to $90, seemingly overnight.

But here is a question that requires careful reasoning: when the price of lettuce rises because of a drought in California, is that inflation? Or is that just one market adjusting to a supply shock?

The answer matters because the two phenomena have different causes and require different responses.

---

### **PRIM-MAC003: Inflation Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given price-level data over time, calculate the inflation rate, distinguish between causes of inflation (demand-pull vs. cost-push), and assess the economic consequences of inflation for different groups (savers, borrowers, wage earners).

*Depends on: PRIM-MAC001 (GDP reasoning -- inflation is distinguished from real growth by separating price changes from quantity changes, Chapter 10)*

**Inflation** is a sustained increase in the **general price level** -- not a one-time price jump, and not a price increase in just one market. It means that on average, across the whole economy, prices are rising.

**How we measure it**: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) tracks the cost of a fixed "basket" of goods and services that a typical household buys (food, housing, transportation, healthcare, entertainment, etc.). The inflation rate is the percentage change in the CPI:

> Inflation rate = (CPI_this year - CPI_last year) / CPI_last year x 100%

**Two causes of inflation**:

- **Demand-pull inflation**: Too much spending chasing too few goods. When aggregate demand grows faster than the economy's ability to produce, prices get bid up across the board. Think of the 2021--2022 period: stimulus checks boosted consumer spending while supply chains were still recovering from COVID-19 disruptions.

- **Cost-push inflation**: Rising production costs force firms to raise prices. When oil prices spike (as in the 1970s), transportation and manufacturing costs rise across the entire economy, pushing up prices for nearly everything.

**Who wins and who loses from inflation?**

| Group | Effect of Unexpected Inflation |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **Borrowers** | WIN -- repay loans with dollars that are worth less than when they borrowed |
| **Lenders / Savers** | LOSE -- the money they are repaid (or have saved) buys less |
| **Workers with cost-of-living adjustments** | Neutral -- wages keep pace with inflation |
| **Workers on fixed salaries** | LOSE -- same nominal pay, less purchasing power |
| **Retirees on fixed pensions** | LOSE -- pension buys less each year |
| **The government (as a borrower)** | WIN -- national debt is repaid in cheaper dollars |

The key distinction: **expected** inflation is less harmful than **unexpected** inflation because people can plan for it (negotiate higher wages, demand higher interest rates on loans). Unexpected inflation blindsides people who made plans based on lower inflation.

**Real-world example**: In 2022, US wages rose about 5% on average while inflation was 8%. Workers received bigger paychecks, but their real purchasing power fell by roughly 3%. If you got a 5% raise and felt like you were falling behind, you were right -- in real terms, you were earning less than the year before.

---

### **PRIM-MAC004: Price Level Reasoning**

> **Reasoning move**: Given economic data, distinguish between changes in the price of individual goods (relative price changes) and changes in the overall price level, and connect the aggregate price level to macroeconomic forces rather than individual market forces.

*Depends on: PRIM-MAC003 (inflation reasoning -- the price level is the aggregate measure whose rate of change is inflation, Chapter 10), PRIM-MKT003 (equilibrium reasoning -- individual prices are determined by market equilibrium; the price level is determined by aggregate equilibrium, Chapter 3)*

This is the analytical move that separates macroeconomic thinking from microeconomic thinking. It answers the question: "Is this price change a market phenomenon or an economy-wide phenomenon?"

**Relative price change**: The price of ONE good changes because of supply-and-demand conditions in THAT market. Lettuce prices rise after a drought. Used car prices spike after a shortage of new cars. These are micro-level events analyzed with supply and demand (Chapter 3).

**Price level change**: The prices of MOST goods change simultaneously because of economy-wide forces. This is inflation (or deflation). The cause is not in any single market -- it is in the aggregate: too much money chasing too few goods (demand-pull), or economy-wide cost increases (cost-push).

**Why this matters**: People routinely confuse the two. In 2022, many blamed inflation on "corporate greed" -- companies raising prices to boost profits. But corporate profit-seeking is not new; companies always try to charge the most they can. What changed was the macroeconomic environment: massive fiscal stimulus increased aggregate demand while supply chains were still disrupted. Price level reasoning separates the macro cause (aggregate demand outpacing aggregate supply) from the micro symptom (higher prices at specific stores).

This distinction also matters for policy. If lettuce prices rise because of a California drought, the correct response is... nothing. The market will adjust. But if the general price level rises 9% because of economy-wide excess demand, the Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates to cool spending. Treating a macro problem with a micro solution (or vice versa) is a policy error that price level reasoning prevents.

> **Reasoning Chain: Inflation and the Cost of Living (CP-006)**
> 1. *PRIM-MON004 (money supply reasoning, Ch 8)*: Between 2020 and 2022, the Federal Reserve expanded the monetary base dramatically through quantitative easing and near-zero interest rates. The M2 money supply grew by over 40% in two years.
> 2. *PRIM-MON001 (money functions reasoning, Ch 8)*: As more money chased the same quantity of goods (or fewer, due to supply chain disruptions), each dollar's purchasing power declined -- money's store-of-value function degraded.
> 3. *PRIM-MAC004 (price level reasoning, Ch 10)*: The general price level rose economy-wide. This was not lettuce getting expensive or used cars getting expensive in isolation -- it was everything getting expensive simultaneously. A macro phenomenon, not a micro one.
> 4. *PRIM-MAC003 (inflation reasoning, Ch 10)*: The CPI measured the rate of increase at 9.1% year-over-year in June 2022. Demand-pull inflation (stimulus-fueled spending) combined with cost-push inflation (supply chain disruptions and energy price spikes).
> 5. *DEF-MAC001 (nominal vs. real, Ch 10)*: Wages rose about 5% nominally but fell roughly 4% in real terms. Borrowers with fixed-rate mortgages benefited (repaying in cheaper dollars). Savers and retirees on fixed incomes were hurt. Inflation redistributed wealth from creditors to debtors.
>
> This chain requires both MAC (to measure and categorize the inflation) and MON (to explain the monetary cause). Neither domain alone tells the full story.

---

### Practice Questions: MAC.4

1. The CPI is 280 in January 2023 and 295 in January 2024. What is the inflation rate?

2. A politician says: "Oil companies are raising gas prices to gouge consumers. That is what is causing inflation." Using price level reasoning, evaluate this claim. Is a gas price increase the same as inflation?

3. You have a savings account with $10,000 earning 2% interest. Inflation is 5%. After one year, how much money do you have in nominal terms? In real terms (purchasing power)?

4. Explain who benefits and who is harmed by unexpected inflation. Why is "unexpected" the key word?

5. In 2022, the prices of both groceries and electronics rose significantly. Give two possible explanations: one that is a relative price change (micro) and one that is a price level change (macro). How would you tell them apart?

## Chapter Summary

This chapter established the **macroeconomic measurement toolkit** -- the five reasoning moves for diagnosing the health of an entire economy. Here is what you can now do:

| ID | Reasoning Move | What It Lets You Do |
|----|---------------|---------------------|
| PRIM-MAC001 | GDP reasoning | Assess total economic output, identify what counts and what does not, interpret growth headlines |
| DEF-MAC001 | Nominal vs. real values | Strip out inflation to compare economic quantities across time; calculate real wages, real interest rates |
| PRIM-MAC002 | Unemployment reasoning | Calculate the unemployment rate, classify unemployment by type, assess labor market health |
| PRIM-MAC003 | Inflation reasoning | Measure the inflation rate, distinguish demand-pull from cost-push, identify winners and losers |
| PRIM-MAC004 | Price level reasoning | Separate individual market price changes from economy-wide inflation; connect the price level to macroeconomic forces |

These five tools let you read the three headlines from the beginning of this chapter and actually understand what they mean -- not just the numbers, but the economic forces behind them.

Chapter 11 (Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply) will build on this foundation by introducing the AD-AS model -- the macroeconomist's equivalent of supply and demand. Where Chapter 3 used supply and demand to analyze individual markets, Chapter 11 will use aggregate demand and aggregate supply to analyze the entire economy. The measurement concepts from this chapter (GDP, price level, unemployment) become the variables that AD-AS explains.

But measurement comes first. Before you can explain why GDP grew or why unemployment rose, you need to know how to measure GDP and unemployment. Before you can ask what caused inflation, you need to distinguish inflation from individual price changes. **How does the economy behave in aggregate?** is the governing question of macroeconomics, and answering it starts with knowing what to measure and how to measure it.
