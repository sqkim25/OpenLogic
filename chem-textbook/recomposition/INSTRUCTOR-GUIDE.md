## Chapter-by-Chapter Guide

### Chapter 1: Composition (COM) — 13 reasoning moves

**Learning Objectives**: After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
1. Identify atoms by their atomic number and locate them on the periodic table (PRIM-COM001, PRIM-COM002)
2. Predict periodic trends in atomic size, electronegativity, and reactivity from position (PRIM-COM003)
3. Classify substances as elements, compounds, or mixtures (PRIM-COM004)
4. Read and interpret chemical formulas (PRIM-COM005)
5. Apply conservation of atoms to verify that mass is neither created nor destroyed (PRIM-COM006)
6. Count valence electrons from group number (PRIM-COM007)
7. Construct multi-step causal reasoning chains (PRIM-COM008)

**Common Misconceptions to Address**:
- "Atoms are like tiny solid balls" — Atoms are mostly empty space
- "Electrons orbit the nucleus like planets" — Electrons occupy probability clouds
- "Elements and compounds are the same as mixtures" — Use the classification flowchart (Figure 1.4)
- "Mass disappears when things burn" — Conservation of atoms; products are gases

**Pedagogical Notes**:
- COM is the foundation domain. Every subsequent chapter depends on it. Invest extra time here if students struggle with periodic table literacy.
- The periodic table should be available during all exams. The goal is to teach students to READ the table, not memorize it.
- PRIM-COM008 (causal chain reasoning) is a metacognitive skill scaffolded throughout the book. Model it explicitly with at least 2 worked examples in class.

**Assessment Suggestions**:
- Periodic table scavenger hunt: Give students 10 elements and ask them to look up Z, group, period, and predict relative size/electronegativity
- Formula reading exercise: Given 5 formulas, identify elements present, count atoms, classify as element/compound
- Conservation challenge: "A 1-kg candle burns down to 50 g of wax. Where did the other 950 g go?"

### Chapter 2: Structure (STR) — 15 reasoning moves

**Learning Objectives**: After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
1. Classify bonds as nonpolar covalent, polar covalent, or ionic using electronegativity difference (PRIM-STR001)
2. Draw Lewis structures for simple molecules (DEF-STR001)
3. Predict molecular shape using VSEPR (PRIM-STR003)
4. Determine whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar from shape and bond polarity (DEF-STR002)
5. Rank intermolecular forces in order of strength (PRIM-STR004)
6. Predict physical properties (boiling point, solubility, phase) from molecular structure (PRIM-STR005)
7. Apply "like dissolves like" to predict solubility (DEF-STR004)

**Common Misconceptions to Address**:
- "Bonds break when substances boil" — Boiling breaks IMFs, not bonds
- "CO₂ is polar because it has polar bonds" — Shape determines net polarity; linear CO₂ has canceling dipoles
- "Larger molecules always have higher boiling points" — IMF type matters more than size (water vs. methane)

**Pedagogical Notes**:
- The IMF hierarchy (PRIM-STR004) is the single most important concept in this chapter. Spend at least 2 full sessions on it.
- Lewis structures are a tool, not the goal. Keep the focus on using Lewis structures to predict shape and polarity, not on memorizing rules for drawing them.
- The two Reasoning Chain callout boxes (water vs. CO₂ polarity, and soap as a molecular bridge) are excellent in-class discussion starters.

**Assessment Suggestions**:
- Molecular comparison: Give pairs of molecules (e.g., CH₄ vs. H₂O) and ask students to predict which has the higher boiling point, with reasoning
- Solubility prediction: Present 4 solute-solvent pairs and predict dissolves/does not dissolve
- Structure-to-property chain: Given a molecule's formula, draw Lewis structure → predict shape → determine polarity → identify IMFs → predict boiling point range

### Chapter 3: Energy (NRG) — 11 reasoning moves

**Learning Objectives**: After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
1. Distinguish between kinetic and potential energy and between heat and work (PRIM-NRG001)
2. Explain why breaking bonds requires energy and forming bonds releases energy (PRIM-NRG002)
3. Classify processes as exothermic or endothermic (PRIM-NRG003)
4. Explain entropy as a tendency toward dispersal (DEF-NRG003)
5. Explain why activation energy creates a barrier between favorable and unfavorable reactions (DEF-NRG004)
6. Predict spontaneity from the interplay of enthalpy and entropy (qualitatively) (PRIM-NRG006)

**Common Misconceptions to Address**:
- "Breaking bonds releases energy" — THE most persistent misconception in chemistry. Dedicate significant time to PRIM-NRG002.
- "Entropy means chaos/mess" — Entropy is about energy dispersal and multiplicity, not disorder in the colloquial sense
- "Exothermic reactions happen spontaneously" — Activation energy prevents spontaneous occurrence (match must be struck)

**Pedagogical Notes**:
- The bond energy misconception deserves a full class session. Use the "burning wood" example (NRG.2, Question 1) as a diagnostic: ask students before teaching whether breaking wood bonds releases energy.
- Keep the math to qualitative comparisons (energy in vs. energy out) — no Hess's law calculations at this level.
- The activation energy concept (DEF-NRG004) connects beautifully to catalysis in Chapter 5 (DEF-CHG002). Foreshadow this connection.

**Assessment Suggestions**:
- Bond energy correction: Present 3 incorrect student statements about energy and ask students to correct them using PRIM-NRG002
- Classification exercise: Given 5 processes, classify each as exothermic/endothermic and predict entropy change direction
- Spontaneity prediction: For 4 scenarios, predict whether the process is spontaneous, using both enthalpy and entropy reasoning

### Chapter 4: Scale (SCL) — 11 reasoning moves

**Learning Objectives**: After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
1. Translate between macroscopic observations and submicroscopic explanations (PRIM-SCL001)
2. Convert between moles, grams, and number of particles using molar mass and Avogadro's number (PRIM-SCL002)
3. Calculate and interpret concentration in molarity, ppm, and ppb (PRIM-SCL003, DEF-SCL001, DEF-SCL002)
4. Use stoichiometric ratios from balanced equations to determine quantities of reactants and products (PRIM-SCL005)
5. Perform and verify calculations using dimensional analysis (PRIM-SCL006)
6. Assess chemical risk by combining hazard data with exposure information (DEF-SCL005)

**Common Misconceptions to Address**:
- "A mole is a very large number" — Correct, but a mole of atoms fits in a tablespoon. The power is in bridging scales.
- "Small concentration = safe" — Lead at 15 ppb is biologically significant. Concentration reasoning requires comparing to thresholds.
- "Units are decoration" — Units are algebraic objects that guide and verify calculations.

**Pedagogical Notes**:
- The mole concept is the biggest conceptual hurdle for non-majors. Use multiple concrete analogies (dozen eggs, ream of paper, mole of atoms).
- The CP-001 and CP-004 capstones at chapter end are excellent exam preparation: they require combining STR + SCL reasoning.
- Safety and risk reasoning (DEF-SCL005) is uniquely valuable for non-majors. Consider a class activity reading real Safety Data Sheets.

**Assessment Suggestions**:
- Mole conversion chain: Given mass → calculate moles → calculate number of particles (and reverse)
- Concentration interpretation: Given a water quality report, identify which contaminants exceed EPA limits
- Proportional reasoning: Given a balanced equation and the mass of one reactant, calculate the mass of product formed

### Chapter 5: Change (CHG) — 12 reasoning moves

**Learning Objectives**: After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
1. Balance simple chemical equations by conserving atoms (PRIM-CHG001)
2. Classify reactions by type: synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, double replacement, combustion (PRIM-CHG002)
3. Distinguish reversible from irreversible reactions and explain dynamic equilibrium (PRIM-CHG003)
4. Apply Le Chatelier's principle to predict how equilibrium shifts when conditions change (DEF-CHG003)
5. Identify factors that affect reaction rate: temperature, concentration, surface area, catalyst (PRIM-CHG004)
6. Classify substances as acids or bases using the Bronsted-Lowry definition (PRIM-CHG005)
7. Identify oxidation and reduction in simple reactions (PRIM-CHG007)

**Common Misconceptions to Address**:
- "Equilibrium means the reaction stopped" — Both forward and reverse reactions continue at equal rates
- "Catalysts are consumed in the reaction" — Catalysts lower activation energy but are regenerated
- "Strong acids are more dangerous than weak acids" — Concentration matters as much as strength (DEF-SCL005 callback)

**Pedagogical Notes**:
- This chapter integrates all prior domains. Backward references are frequent and intentional. If students struggle, the issue is usually a gap in COM or STR, not CHG itself.
- Four CP capstones (CP-002, CP-003, CP-005, CP-006) appear at chapter end. These are the most challenging content in the book. Consider assigning them as group work rather than individual homework.
- The acid-base section stays qualitative (Bronsted-Lowry classification, pH scale interpretation). No Ka calculations.

**Assessment Suggestions**:
- Equilibrium scenario: Present a system at equilibrium, apply a stress, ask students to predict the shift direction with reasoning
- Multi-domain chain: "Why does antacid relieve heartburn?" (acid-base + dissolution + concentration reasoning)
- Redox identification: Given 4 reactions, identify which involve electron transfer and label the oxidized/reduced species

### Chapter 6: Chemistry Meets Life (MULTI) — Optional Capstone

**Learning Objectives**: After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
1. Explain DNA structure using reasoning moves from STR (bond types, hydrogen bonding, molecular shape)
2. Explain protein folding and denaturation using IMF hierarchy
3. Connect metabolic processes to energy reasoning from NRG

**Pedagogical Notes**:
- This chapter introduces no new reasoning moves. It demonstrates that the 62 moves from Chapters 1-5 are sufficient to explain biological chemistry.
- Ideal for the final week of a semester or as a take-home capstone project.
- The "boil an egg" question (Question 1) makes an excellent final exam essay question because it integrates STR, NRG, and CHG reasoning.

## Assessment Philosophy

This textbook prioritizes **reasoning over recall**. Assessment should follow the same principle:

1. **Always allow the periodic table** — the goal is reading the table, not memorizing it
2. **Ask "why" and "how" questions, not "what" questions** — "Why does water have a higher boiling point than methane?" not "What is the boiling point of water?"
3. **Require explicit reasoning-move citations** — Train students to name the move they are using (e.g., "Using PRIM-STR004, I rank the IMFs...")
4. **Include multi-step reasoning chains** — The most valuable assessment items require 3-4 reasoning moves in sequence
5. **Use real-world contexts** — Cleaning products, food labels, water quality reports, medications

## Enrichment Section Guidance

Enrichment (E) sections can be:
- **Included in full**: For courses with stronger student preparation or more time
