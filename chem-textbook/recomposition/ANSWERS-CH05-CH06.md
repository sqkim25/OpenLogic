## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.1, Question 1

**Question**: Balance the following equation for the combustion of ethanol (C₂H₅OH): C₂H₅OH + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O. How many moles of O₂ are needed per mole of ethanol? How many moles of CO₂ are produced?

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move here is **PRIM-CHG001 (Equation reading and balancing)**: given a chemical equation with reactants and products, balance it so that atoms of each element are conserved on both sides, and extract the quantitative mole ratios. We also rely on **PRIM-COM006 (Conservation of atoms)** from Chapter 1 -- the principle that no atom is created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.

We begin by counting atoms in the unbalanced equation. On the left, ethanol (C₂H₅OH) contains 2 carbon atoms, 6 hydrogen atoms (5 from the C₂H₅ group plus 1 from the OH group), and 1 oxygen atom (in the OH group), plus the O₂ reactant. On the right, we have CO₂ and H₂O. Step 1: Balance carbon by placing a coefficient of 2 in front of CO₂, giving 2 carbon atoms on each side. Step 2: Balance hydrogen by placing a coefficient of 3 in front of H₂O (since 6 hydrogen atoms on the left require 3 H₂O molecules, each with 2 hydrogen atoms: 3 x 2 = 6). Step 3: Count oxygen on the right: 2 CO₂ contributes 4 oxygen atoms and 3 H₂O contributes 3 oxygen atoms, totaling 7 oxygen atoms. On the left, ethanol already contributes 1 oxygen atom, so we need 6 more from O₂. Since each O₂ molecule provides 2 oxygen atoms, we need 3 O₂ molecules. The balanced equation is: C₂H₅OH + 3 O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 3 H₂O.

Verification: Left side -- C: 2, H: 6, O: 1 + 6 = 7. Right side -- C: 2, H: 6, O: 4 + 3 = 7. All atoms balance. Therefore, **3 moles of O₂** are needed per mole of ethanol, and **2 moles of CO₂** are produced. In a real-world context, ethanol is the alcohol in beer and wine, and this combustion reaction is the same chemistry at work in ethanol-blended gasoline ("E85"), where knowing the stoichiometric ratio ensures the engine receives enough oxygen for complete combustion.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.1, Question 2

**Question**: Classify each reaction by type: (a) 2 Na + Cl₂ → 2 NaCl; (b) CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂; (c) AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO₃. For each, explain how you recognized the type from the reactant-product pattern.

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move for all three parts is **PRIM-CHG002 (Reaction type recognition)**: given reactants, classify the transformation type and use the classification to predict the general form of the products. We also draw on **PRIM-STR001 (Bond type classification)** from Chapter 2 to identify whether the reactants are elements, ionic compounds, or molecular compounds.

**(a) 2 Na + Cl₂ → 2 NaCl.** This is a **synthesis (combination)** reaction. The pattern is A + B → AB: two simple substances (elemental sodium, a metal, and elemental chlorine, a diatomic nonmetal) combine to form a single, more complex product (sodium chloride, an ionic compound). We recognize this type because there are two elemental reactants and only one product. Sodium metal, which you might encounter as an industrial chemical, reacts vigorously with chlorine gas to produce ordinary table salt -- a dramatic demonstration that the properties of a compound differ entirely from those of its constituent elements.

**(b) CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂.** This is a **decomposition** reaction. The pattern is AB → A + B: a single compound (calcium carbonate) breaks apart into two simpler products (calcium oxide and carbon dioxide). We recognize this type because there is only one reactant and multiple products. This is the reaction that occurs when limestone is heated in a kiln to produce quicklime (CaO), a process used in cement manufacturing for thousands of years.

**(c) AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO₃.** This is a **double replacement (metathesis)** reaction. The pattern is AB + CD → AD + CB: two ionic compounds swap their cation-anion partners. Silver pairs with chloride (forming insoluble AgCl), and sodium pairs with nitrate (forming soluble NaNO₃). We recognize this type because two ionic compounds are present as reactants and the products show the cations and anions having exchanged partners. The formation of the white precipitate AgCl is what drives this reaction to completion -- one of the products is removed from solution as an insoluble solid.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.1, Question 3

**Question**: A student writes the equation: H₂ + O₂ → H₂O. They claim it is balanced because "hydrogen and oxygen are on both sides." What mistake are they making? Balance the equation correctly and verify by counting atoms.

**Model Answer**:

This question tests **PRIM-CHG001 (Equation reading and balancing)** and the underlying principle of **PRIM-COM006 (Conservation of atoms)**. The student's mistake is a fundamental misunderstanding of what "balanced" means. Balancing requires that the *number of each type of atom* is identical on both sides -- not merely that the same *elements* appear on both sides.

Let us count atoms in the student's equation. On the left: H₂ contributes 2 hydrogen atoms and O₂ contributes 2 oxygen atoms. On the right: H₂O contributes 2 hydrogen atoms and only 1 oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms balance (2 = 2), but the oxygen atoms do not (2 on the left, 1 on the right). The student has noticed that hydrogen and oxygen both appear on each side but has not actually counted the atoms. This is like saying a recipe is "balanced" because it lists flour on the ingredients side and flour in the cake -- without checking whether the amounts match.

To balance correctly: place a coefficient of 2 in front of H₂O to get 2 oxygen atoms on the right: H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O. Now count hydrogen: the right side has 2 x 2 = 4 hydrogen atoms, but the left side has only 2. Place a coefficient of 2 in front of H₂: 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O. Verification: Left -- H: 4, O: 2. Right -- H: 4, O: 2. Every atom is accounted for. The correctly balanced equation tells us the mole ratio is 2:1:2 -- two moles of hydrogen gas react with one mole of oxygen gas to produce two moles of water. The key lesson is that balancing means counting atoms, not just listing elements.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.2, Question 1

**Question**: Consider the reaction: 2 SO₂(g) + O₂(g) ⇌ 2 SO₃(g), which is exothermic in the forward direction. Predict the effect of each stress on the equilibrium: (a) Adding more O₂; (b) Raising the temperature; (c) Increasing the total pressure.

**Model Answer**:

This question deploys **DEF-CHG003 (Le Chatelier's principle)**: given a system at equilibrium plus a stress, predict the direction the equilibrium shifts to partially counteract the stress. It builds on **PRIM-CHG003 (Equilibrium reasoning)**, which establishes that equilibrium is a dynamic state where forward and reverse rates are equal.

**(a) Adding more O₂.** Increasing the concentration of a reactant is a stress. The system responds by shifting toward **products** (to the right) to partially consume the added O₂. More SO₃ will be produced. Note that the system only *partially* counteracts the stress -- the new equilibrium concentration of O₂ will still be higher than it was before the addition, but lower than it would be if the system did not respond.

**(b) Raising the temperature.** Since the forward reaction is exothermic, we can think of heat as a "product." Adding heat (raising the temperature) is like adding more product. The system shifts toward **reactants** (to the left) to partially counteract the added heat by favoring the endothermic reverse direction. At the new equilibrium, less SO₃ is present. This is an important industrial consideration: the production of SO₃ (a key step in manufacturing sulfuric acid) is favored at lower temperatures, but lower temperatures also slow the rate -- a trade-off between equilibrium position and reaction speed.

**(c) Increasing the total pressure.** Count the moles of gas on each side: left has 2 + 1 = 3 moles of gas, right has 2 moles of gas. Increasing pressure shifts equilibrium toward the side with **fewer gas molecules** -- in this case, toward the **products** (to the right). More SO₃ is produced. The system partially counteracts the increased pressure by reducing the total number of gas molecules.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.2, Question 2

**Question**: A student says, "At equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products are equal." Is this correct? Explain using the concept of K (large vs. small).

**Model Answer**:

The relevant reasoning move is **PRIM-CHG003 (Equilibrium reasoning)**: understanding that equilibrium is a dynamic steady state where forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, not where concentrations are equal. The student's statement is **incorrect**, and this is one of the most common misconceptions about equilibrium.

At equilibrium, the *rates* of the forward and reverse reactions are equal -- not the *concentrations* of reactants and products. The actual concentrations at equilibrium depend on the equilibrium constant, K. If K is very large (much greater than 1), the equilibrium strongly favors products -- meaning at equilibrium, the concentration of products is much higher than the concentration of reactants. If K is very small (much less than 1), the equilibrium strongly favors reactants -- meaning at equilibrium, the concentration of reactants is much higher than the concentration of products. Only in the special case where K is approximately equal to 1 are the concentrations of reactants and products comparable -- and even then, they are not necessarily exactly equal.

Consider the combustion of propane: this reaction has an extremely large K, meaning that at equilibrium, essentially all the propane and oxygen have been converted to CO₂ and H₂O. Conversely, the dissociation of water into H₂ and O₂ at room temperature has an extremely small K, meaning that at equilibrium, virtually no dissociation has occurred. Equilibrium is a balance of rates, not a balance of amounts. The position of that balance -- whether it leans toward reactants or products -- is what K tells you.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.2, Question 3

**Question**: Explain, using Le Chatelier's principle, why a sealed bottle of soda remains fizzy in the refrigerator but goes flat quickly once opened and left on a warm countertop. (Hint: consider both temperature and pressure changes.)

**Model Answer**:

This question requires combining **DEF-CHG003 (Le Chatelier's principle)** with **PRIM-CHG003 (Equilibrium reasoning)** to analyze two simultaneous stresses -- a pressure change and a temperature change -- acting on the CO₂ dissolution equilibrium: CO₂(dissolved) ⇌ CO₂(gas).

First, consider the sealed bottle in the refrigerator. Inside the sealed bottle, CO₂ is at equilibrium between its dissolved and gaseous forms under high pressure (the headspace in the bottle is pressurized with CO₂). The high pressure pushes the equilibrium toward the dissolved side, keeping plenty of CO₂ in solution. Additionally, the cold temperature of the refrigerator favors dissolution because dissolving CO₂ in water is slightly exothermic (releases heat). Le Chatelier's principle tells us that lowering the temperature shifts the equilibrium toward the exothermic direction -- toward dissolution. Both the high pressure and the low temperature favor keeping CO₂ dissolved. The soda stays fizzy.

Now consider what happens when you open the bottle and leave it on a warm countertop. Two stresses hit simultaneously. **Stress 1 (pressure decrease):** Opening the bottle releases the pressurized CO₂ gas above the liquid. The gas-phase CO₂ pressure drops to atmospheric levels. Le Chatelier's principle predicts the equilibrium shifts toward the gas phase to partially restore the lost gas-phase CO₂. Dissolved CO₂ escapes as bubbles. **Stress 2 (temperature increase):** The warm countertop raises the temperature. Since dissolution is exothermic, raising temperature shifts equilibrium away from the dissolved form, further driving CO₂ out of solution. Both stresses push in the same direction -- toward CO₂ escaping -- which is why warm, open soda goes flat rapidly. The fizz is lost because both the pressure and temperature changes conspire to shift the equilibrium toward gaseous CO₂.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.3, Question 1

**Question**: Explain why a log in a fireplace burns slowly, but sawdust from the same log can explode in a confined space. Which factor from the rate table is most relevant?

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move is **PRIM-CHG004 (Rate reasoning)**: given conditions such as temperature, concentration, surface area, and the presence of a catalyst, predict whether the reaction rate will increase or decrease, using collision theory as the explanatory framework. The most relevant factor here is **surface area**.

A log in a fireplace is a solid block of wood. Only the molecules at the outer surface are exposed to oxygen in the air. The interior wood molecules are shielded -- oxygen cannot reach them. The combustion reaction can only occur at the wood-air interface, so the log burns slowly, consuming itself layer by layer from the outside inward. Now take that same wood and grind it into fine sawdust. The total mass is the same, and the chemical composition is identical, but the total surface area has increased enormously. Each tiny particle of sawdust exposes nearly all of its molecules to the surrounding air. When this sawdust is dispersed in a confined space (such as a grain elevator or a flour mill), virtually every particle is in contact with oxygen simultaneously.

Using **collision theory**, we reason that more exposed surface area means more wood molecules are available to collide with oxygen molecules at the same time. The reaction rate skyrockets. If the sawdust is suspended in air within an enclosed space, the rapid combustion releases heat faster than it can dissipate, causing a pressure buildup that results in an explosion. This is not a different chemical reaction -- it is the same combustion of wood. The only thing that changed was the surface area. This is why grain elevators, coal mines, and flour mills have strict dust-control protocols: fine particulate matter suspended in air is an explosion hazard precisely because of the surface area effect on reaction rate.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.3, Question 2

**Question**: A student claims that adding a catalyst to a reaction will produce more product at equilibrium. Is this correct? Explain.

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move is **DEF-CHG001 (Catalyst)**: a catalyst speeds a reaction by providing a lower-activation-energy pathway, without being consumed in the process. The student's claim is **incorrect**.

A catalyst lowers the activation energy (Ea) for both the forward and reverse reactions equally. This means both the forward reaction and the reverse reaction speed up by the same factor. The system reaches equilibrium faster, but the equilibrium position itself -- the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations, described by the equilibrium constant K -- does not change. If a reaction produces 70% products at equilibrium without a catalyst, it will still produce 70% products with a catalyst. It will simply arrive at that 70% mark sooner.

Think of it using the mountain-pass analogy from the chapter. A catalyst carves a lower pass through the mountain, making it easier for molecules to cross in both directions. But the starting elevation (reactants' energy) and the ending elevation (products' energy) remain the same. Since K depends only on the energy difference between reactants and products (thermodynamics), and a catalyst does not change that energy difference, K is unchanged. The student is confusing rate (how fast equilibrium is reached) with position (where equilibrium lies). This confusion between "faster" and "more" is one of the most persistent misconceptions in introductory chemistry. A catalyst affects *when* you arrive at equilibrium, not *where* equilibrium lies.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.3, Question 3

**Question**: Use collision theory to explain why food spoils faster on a hot summer day than in a refrigerator. Which of the three collision requirements (collision frequency, energy, orientation) is most affected by the temperature change?

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move is **PRIM-CHG004 (Rate reasoning)**: given conditions (temperature, concentration, surface area, catalyst), predict whether the reaction rate will increase or decrease, using collision theory as the explanatory framework. We also draw on **PRIM-NRG006 (Activation energy reasoning)** from Chapter 3, which establishes that reactions require molecules to overcome an energy barrier.

Food spoilage involves chemical reactions -- oxidation of fats, enzyme-catalyzed breakdown of proteins, bacterial metabolism of sugars. All of these are chemical transformations governed by the same collision theory principles. For a reaction to occur, molecules must (1) collide, (2) collide with sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, and (3) collide with the correct orientation. On a hot summer day, the temperature is higher, which means the molecules in the food have greater average kinetic energy.

The factor **most affected** by the temperature change is the **energy** requirement -- specifically, the fraction of molecular collisions that have enough energy to exceed the activation energy barrier (Ea). At higher temperatures, a larger fraction of molecules possess kinetic energy equal to or greater than Ea. This dramatically increases the number of *effective* collisions (those that actually lead to reaction). Collision frequency also increases somewhat at higher temperature (faster-moving molecules encounter each other more often), but the dominant effect is the exponential increase in the fraction of molecules clearing the energy barrier. The orientation requirement is essentially unaffected by temperature -- molecular geometries do not change with temperature.

This is why refrigeration works: by lowering the temperature, we reduce the fraction of molecules with sufficient energy to overcome Ea. The spoilage reactions are still thermodynamically favorable (the food is still unstable), but they proceed so slowly in the cold that the food remains edible for days or weeks. The refrigerator does not change *whether* food spoils -- it changes *how fast*.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.4, Question 1

**Question**: Identify the Bronsted acid and Bronsted base in the following reaction. Name the conjugate acid and conjugate base. NH₃ + H₂O ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move is **PRIM-CHG005 (Acid-base reasoning)**: given two substances, identify the proton donor (Bronsted acid) and proton acceptor (Bronsted base), and predict the products of the proton transfer. This also connects to **PRIM-STR002 (Bond polarity reasoning)** from Chapter 2, which helps us understand why certain molecules donate or accept protons.

In this reaction, a proton (H⁺) is transferred from water to ammonia. **Water (H₂O) is the Bronsted acid** because it donates a proton. **Ammonia (NH₃) is the Bronsted base** because it accepts a proton. After the proton transfer, water has lost an H⁺ and become OH⁻, which is the **conjugate base** of water. Ammonia has gained an H⁺ and become NH₄⁺ (the ammonium ion), which is the **conjugate acid** of ammonia.

The two conjugate pairs are: (1) NH₃ / NH₄⁺ -- the base and its conjugate acid, and (2) H₂O / OH⁻ -- the acid and its conjugate base. Notice that water acts as the acid in this reaction, donating a proton to ammonia. This is noteworthy because in other reactions (such as HCl + H₂O), water acts as a base, accepting a proton. Water's ability to act as either an acid or a base depending on its reaction partner makes it an **amphoteric** substance. The double arrow (⇌) indicates this is a reversible reaction -- ammonia is a weak base, meaning only a small fraction of NH₃ molecules accept protons at any given time, and the equilibrium lies to the left. Most of the ammonia remains as NH₃ in solution.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.4, Question 2

**Question**: A swimming pool has a pH of 8.5. Is this within the ideal range? Would you add an acid or a base to correct it? In which direction would the correction change the H⁺ concentration?

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning moves are **DEF-CHG002 (pH scale)** -- classifying a solution as acidic, neutral, or basic and relating pH to H⁺ concentration -- and **PRIM-CHG005 (Acid-base reasoning)** for understanding how adding an acid or base changes the system.

The ideal pH range for a swimming pool is 7.2 to 7.8. A pH of 8.5 is **above the ideal range** -- the water is too basic. At this pH, the chlorine disinfectant shifts to a less active chemical form (hypochlorite ion, OCl⁻, rather than the more effective hypochlorous acid, HOCl), reducing its ability to kill bacteria. The water may also promote scale deposits on pool surfaces and equipment.

To correct the pH, you would **add an acid** (such as muriatic acid, which is hydrochloric acid, HCl, or sodium bisulfate). Adding an acid introduces H⁺ ions into the water. This **increases the H⁺ concentration**, which lowers the pH from 8.5 toward the target range of 7.2-7.8. Remember that the pH scale runs inversely to H⁺ concentration: lower pH means more H⁺. Since the pH scale is logarithmic (each unit represents a tenfold change in H⁺ concentration), moving from pH 8.5 to pH 7.5 would require roughly a tenfold increase in H⁺ concentration. This is why pool chemistry requires careful measurement and gradual adjustment -- seemingly small changes in pH correspond to large changes in the actual concentration of hydrogen ions.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.4, Question 3

**Question**: Stomach acid has a pH of about 1.5. Milk has a pH of about 6.5. How many times greater is the H⁺ concentration in stomach acid compared to milk? (Hint: each pH unit is a tenfold change, and the difference is 5 units.)

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move is **DEF-CHG002 (pH scale)**: relating pH to H⁺ concentration. This also draws on **PRIM-SCL003 (Concentration reasoning)** from Chapter 4, which connects the amount of solute per volume to measurable effects.

The pH difference between stomach acid (pH 1.5) and milk (pH 6.5) is 6.5 - 1.5 = 5 units. Since each pH unit represents a **tenfold (10x) change** in H⁺ concentration, a difference of 5 pH units corresponds to 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10⁵ = **100,000 times** greater H⁺ concentration. Stomach acid contains 100,000 times more H⁺ ions per unit volume than milk.

This enormous difference explains why stomach acid can break down food but milk cannot. The H⁺ concentration in stomach acid is high enough to denature proteins, activate digestive enzymes (like pepsin), and kill most ingested bacteria. The stomach lining protects itself with a thick mucus barrier, but even slight disruption of that barrier (as discussed in the aspirin capstone, CP-003) allows the acid to attack the underlying tissue. The 100,000-fold difference also illustrates why the logarithmic pH scale is practical: it compresses an enormous range of H⁺ concentrations (from about 1 mole per liter at pH 0 to 0.0000000000001 moles per liter at pH 14) into a manageable 0-to-14 scale. Without the logarithmic compression, comparing stomach acid to milk would require writing out concentrations with many zeros.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.5, Question 1

**Question**: In the reaction 2 Mg + O₂ → 2 MgO, identify which species is oxidized and which is reduced. Assign oxidation numbers to each element before and after the reaction.

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move is **PRIM-CHG006 (Oxidation-reduction reasoning)**: given a process, identify the electron transfer -- which species is oxidized (loses electrons) and which is reduced (gains electrons). We also use the oxidation number rules from the chapter to track electron changes systematically.

**Assigning oxidation numbers before the reaction (reactant side):** Magnesium (Mg) is in its elemental form, so its oxidation number is **0**. Oxygen (O₂) is in its elemental form, so its oxidation number is **0**.

**Assigning oxidation numbers after the reaction (product side):** In MgO, oxygen has its standard oxidation number of **-2**. Since MgO is a neutral compound, the oxidation numbers must sum to zero: Mg + (-2) = 0, so magnesium has an oxidation number of **+2**.

**Identifying the electron transfer:** Magnesium went from 0 to +2. An increase in oxidation number means loss of electrons. **Magnesium is oxidized** -- each Mg atom loses 2 electrons. Oxygen went from 0 to -2. A decrease in oxidation number means gain of electrons. **Oxygen is reduced** -- each O atom gains 2 electrons. Using the OIL RIG mnemonic: Oxidation Is Loss (Mg loses electrons), Reduction Is Gain (O gains electrons).

We can verify electron conservation: 2 Mg atoms each lose 2 electrons = 4 electrons lost total. 2 O atoms (from O₂) each gain 2 electrons = 4 electrons gained total. Electrons lost equal electrons gained, confirming conservation. This reaction is what occurs when magnesium ribbon is burned in air -- it produces an intensely bright white flame (used in old-fashioned camera flashbulbs and in fireworks) because the Mg-O bond formation releases a large amount of energy, partly as visible light.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.5, Question 2

**Question**: A student says, "In a battery, electrons are created at the negative terminal and destroyed at the positive terminal." Using conservation reasoning (PRIM-COM006, Chapter 1) and redox reasoning, explain what is wrong with this statement.

**Model Answer**:

This question requires two reasoning moves working together: **PRIM-COM006 (Conservation of atoms)** from Chapter 1, extended here to conservation of charge (electrons are not created or destroyed), and **PRIM-CHG006 (Oxidation-reduction reasoning)**, which identifies the electron transfer occurring at each terminal.

The student's statement violates a fundamental conservation principle. Electrons are subatomic particles with mass and charge -- they cannot be created from nothing or destroyed into nothing, just as atoms cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. What actually happens in a battery is an **electron transfer**, not electron creation and destruction.

At the negative terminal (anode), a chemical species is **oxidized** -- it *loses* electrons that it already possessed. In a typical alkaline battery, zinc atoms lose electrons: Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻. The electrons were always part of the zinc atoms; oxidation simply releases them from the zinc. At the positive terminal (cathode), a chemical species is **reduced** -- it *gains* those same electrons. Manganese dioxide accepts the electrons that zinc released. The electrons flow from the anode through the external circuit (through your flashlight, phone, or other device) to the cathode. This flow of existing electrons through the circuit is the electrical current.

No electrons are created. No electrons are destroyed. The total number of electrons in the system remains constant throughout the battery's life. This is directly analogous to the conservation of atoms in a chemical reaction: atoms rearrange but are never created or destroyed, and electrons transfer but are never created or destroyed. The battery is a device that harnesses a spontaneous electron transfer (a favorable redox reaction) by forcing the electrons to travel through an external circuit on their way from the oxidized species to the reduced species.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.5, Question 3

**Question**: Explain why silver jewelry tarnishes (reacts with sulfur compounds in the air) but gold jewelry does not. Use periodic position reasoning (PRIM-COM003, Chapter 1) and oxidation-reduction reasoning.

**Model Answer**:

This question combines **PRIM-CHG006 (Oxidation-reduction reasoning)** -- identifying electron transfer and which species is oxidized -- with **PRIM-COM003 (Periodic position reasoning)** from Chapter 1, which uses an element's position on the periodic table to predict its chemical behavior.

Tarnishing is a redox reaction. When silver jewelry tarnishes, silver atoms at the surface are **oxidized** -- they lose electrons to sulfur compounds (such as hydrogen sulfide, H₂S) in the air. The silver goes from oxidation number 0 (metallic silver) to +1 (in silver sulfide, Ag₂S), the dark coating we see as tarnish: 4 Ag + 2 H₂S + O₂ → 2 Ag₂S + 2 H₂O. Silver is oxidized (loses electrons); sulfur is reduced (gains electrons).

Gold, in contrast, does not tarnish. The explanation lies in **periodic position reasoning**. Gold (Au) is located in period 6 of the transition metals, much further along than silver (Ag) in period 5. Gold has a very high nuclear charge (79 protons) and a particular electron configuration that holds its outer electrons exceptionally tightly. This means gold resists oxidation -- it does not readily lose its electrons to oxygen, sulfur, or other common oxidizing agents in the environment. Silver, while also a relatively noble metal, holds its electrons less tightly than gold and can be oxidized by sulfur compounds under ordinary conditions.

This difference in oxidation resistance is why gold has been prized throughout human history. Gold jewelry recovered from ancient Egyptian tombs, thousands of years old, remains shiny and untarnished. Silver jewelry, by contrast, requires regular polishing to remove the Ag₂S tarnish layer. The chemical basis for this cultural value is straightforward redox reasoning combined with periodic trends: gold's position on the periodic table makes it extraordinarily resistant to electron loss, while silver's position makes it susceptible to oxidation by sulfur compounds, though still resistant to oxidation by oxygen alone under normal conditions.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.E, Question 1

**Question**: Radon-222 undergoes alpha decay. Write the nuclear equation. What element is produced? (Hint: radon has Z = 86.)

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move is **PRIM-CHG007 (Nuclear change reasoning)**: given an unstable nucleus, predict the type of radiation emitted, write the nuclear equation, and distinguish nuclear change from chemical change. We apply the conservation rules for nuclear equations: both mass number (A) and atomic number (Z) must be conserved on both sides.

In **alpha decay**, the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is a helium-4 nucleus: ⁴₂He (2 protons and 2 neutrons). This means the parent nucleus loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The parent nucleus is radon-222: ²²²₈₆Rn. After emitting an alpha particle, the daughter nucleus has: mass number = 222 - 4 = 218, and atomic number = 86 - 2 = 84. The element with atomic number 84 is **polonium (Po)**.

The nuclear equation is: ²²²₈₆Rn → ²¹⁸₈₄Po + ⁴₂He

**Verification:** Mass numbers: 222 = 218 + 4. Atomic numbers: 86 = 84 + 2. Both are conserved. This is analogous to balancing a chemical equation (PRIM-CHG001), but the conserved quantities are mass number and atomic number rather than atom counts. Radon-222 is a real health concern: it is a naturally occurring radioactive gas produced by the decay of uranium in soil and rock. It can seep into basements and accumulate to dangerous levels. The alpha particles emitted by radon (and its decay products) can damage lung tissue, making radon the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. Home radon testing kits detect this radioactive decay and are recommended by public health agencies.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.E, Question 2

**Question**: A sample of iodine-131 (half-life = 8 days) is used for a medical scan. If the initial dose is 100 micrograms, how much remains after 24 days? After 32 days?

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move is **DEF-CHG004 (Half-life)**: given an isotope and its half-life, predict the amount remaining after a whole number of half-lives. The formula is straightforward: amount remaining = original amount x (1/2)ⁿ, where n is the number of half-lives elapsed.

**After 24 days:** The number of half-lives elapsed is 24 days / 8 days per half-life = **3 half-lives**. Starting with 100 micrograms: after 1 half-life (8 days): 100 x 1/2 = 50 micrograms. After 2 half-lives (16 days): 50 x 1/2 = 25 micrograms. After 3 half-lives (24 days): 25 x 1/2 = **12.5 micrograms**. Equivalently: 100 x (1/2)³ = 100 x 1/8 = 12.5 micrograms.

**After 32 days:** The number of half-lives elapsed is 32 days / 8 days per half-life = **4 half-lives**. Continuing from above: after 4 half-lives (32 days): 12.5 x 1/2 = **6.25 micrograms**. Equivalently: 100 x (1/2)⁴ = 100 x 1/16 = 6.25 micrograms.

The short half-life of iodine-131 is precisely why it is useful in medical imaging. The iodine is selectively absorbed by the thyroid gland, where its radioactive decay can be detected by imaging equipment to assess thyroid function. Because it decays relatively quickly (half-life of only 8 days), the patient's radiation exposure is limited -- within about 5-6 half-lives (40-48 days), the amount of I-131 in the body has dropped to less than 2-3% of the original dose. This balance between being radioactive long enough to be medically useful but short-lived enough to minimize harm is what makes I-131 one of the most important isotopes in nuclear medicine.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.E, Question 3

**Question**: Predict whether a precipitate forms when each pair of solutions is mixed. If so, identify the precipitate. (a) Potassium chloride (KCl) + sodium nitrate (NaNO₃); (b) Lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO₃)₂) + potassium iodide (KI). [Hint: PbI₂ is insoluble.]

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move is **DEF-CHG005 (Precipitation)**: given two ionic solutions, predict whether mixing them will produce an insoluble solid (precipitate) using solubility rules. This is a specialized form of **PRIM-CHG002 (Reaction type recognition)** -- specifically, a double replacement reaction where the ions swap partners.

**(a) KCl + NaNO₃.** First, identify the ions present when both salts dissolve: K⁺, Cl⁻, Na⁺, and NO₃⁻. Now consider the possible new ion pairings: KNO₃ (potassium nitrate) and NaCl (sodium chloride). Check the solubility rules: all potassium (K⁺) compounds are soluble, all sodium (Na⁺) compounds are soluble, all nitrates (NO₃⁻) are soluble, and all chlorides (Cl⁻) are soluble except AgCl, PbCl₂, and Hg₂Cl₂. Both possible products are soluble. **No precipitate forms.** The ions simply remain dissolved in solution -- nothing happens when you mix these two solutions. This is called a "no reaction" result.

**(b) Pb(NO₃)₂ + KI.** The ions present are: Pb²⁺, NO₃⁻, K⁺, and I⁻. The possible new pairings are: PbI₂ (lead(II) iodide) and KNO₃ (potassium nitrate). The hint tells us that PbI₂ is insoluble. KNO₃ is soluble (all K⁺ and all NO₃⁻ compounds are soluble). Therefore, **a precipitate does form: PbI₂** (lead(II) iodide), which is a bright yellow solid. The balanced equation is: Pb(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2 KI(aq) → PbI₂(s) + 2 KNO₃(aq). This reaction is a classic demonstration in chemistry labs -- mixing two colorless solutions produces a striking yellow precipitate, dramatically illustrating the concept of precipitation. The (s) notation indicates the solid precipitate; (aq) indicates species remaining dissolved in solution.

## Chapter 5 (CHG): Section 5.E, Question 4

**Question**: Explain why radioactive half-life is unaffected by temperature, while chemical reaction rates (PRIM-CHG004) are strongly temperature-dependent. What is fundamentally different about nuclear processes versus chemical processes?

**Model Answer**:

This question requires contrasting **DEF-CHG004 (Half-life)** and **PRIM-CHG007 (Nuclear change reasoning)** with **PRIM-CHG004 (Rate reasoning)**. The key distinction lies in *where* in the atom the process occurs and *which forces* govern it.

Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of **electrons** and **chemical bonds** -- the outer shell of the atom. These processes are governed by electromagnetic forces between electrons and nuclei. Temperature affects chemical reaction rates because temperature determines the kinetic energy of molecules, which determines how often and how energetically they collide. Higher temperature means more molecules exceed the activation energy barrier (Ea), so the reaction rate increases. This is collision theory: the rate depends on the fraction of molecules with sufficient energy to overcome a barrier created by electromagnetic interactions between electrons.

Nuclear decay, by contrast, involves transformations within the **nucleus** itself -- the rearrangement of protons and neutrons. These processes are governed by the **strong nuclear force** and the **weak nuclear force**, which operate at scales far smaller than atomic dimensions and at energies millions of times greater than chemical bond energies. The energy barrier for nuclear transformation is so enormous compared to thermal energies at any temperature achievable on Earth that temperature changes are utterly insignificant. Heating a radioactive sample from 25 degrees Celsius to 1,000 degrees Celsius increases the thermal energy of the atoms, but that increase is negligible compared to the energies involved in nuclear stability. It is like trying to move a mountain by blowing on it.

This fundamental difference -- electrons and electromagnetic forces for chemistry versus nucleons and nuclear forces for radioactivity -- is why chemical reaction rates depend on temperature, concentration, surface area, and catalysts, while radioactive half-lives are completely independent of all external conditions. No amount of heating, cooling, compressing, dissolving, or catalyzing can change how fast a radioactive nucleus decays. This invariance is precisely what makes radioactive isotopes reliable clocks for dating archaeological artifacts and geological formations.

## Chapter 6 (MULTI): Practice Questions, Question 1

**Question**: When you boil an egg, the clear, liquid egg white becomes solid and opaque. At the molecular level, the proteins in the egg white are unfolding -- their hydrogen bonds, London dispersion forces, and ionic interactions are disrupted by the heat. Using PRIM-STR004 (IMF hierarchy) and PRIM-CHG004 (rate reasoning), explain why the egg cooks faster in boiling water (100 degrees Celsius) than at room temperature. Why is the process irreversible -- that is, why does the egg not become liquid again when it cools?

**Model Answer**:

This question combines **PRIM-STR004 (Intermolecular force hierarchy)** from Chapter 2 -- identifying which intermolecular forces hold a protein in its folded shape -- with **PRIM-CHG004 (Rate reasoning)** from Chapter 5 -- predicting how temperature affects the rate of the unfolding process.

**Why the egg cooks faster in boiling water:** Protein denaturation (unfolding) is a chemical process that requires breaking the intermolecular forces holding the protein in its folded shape: hydrogen bonds between polar groups, London dispersion forces between nonpolar side chains buried in the protein interior, and ionic interactions (salt bridges) between charged side chains. Breaking these forces requires energy -- molecules must collide with enough kinetic energy to overcome the energy barriers that hold the folded structure together. Using **PRIM-CHG004 (rate reasoning)** and collision theory, we reason that at 100 degrees Celsius, the water molecules and the protein molecules have much greater kinetic energy than at room temperature (approximately 25 degrees Celsius). A larger fraction of molecular collisions deliver enough energy to disrupt the hydrogen bonds, London forces, and ionic interactions that maintain the protein fold. The rate of denaturation therefore increases dramatically. At room temperature, some denaturation could theoretically occur, but the rate is so slow as to be negligible on any practical timescale.

**Why the process is irreversible:** Using **PRIM-STR004 (IMF hierarchy)**, we recognize that the folded shape of a protein is a precise three-dimensional arrangement stabilized by hundreds of specific intermolecular interactions -- each hydrogen bond, each London force contact, each salt bridge positioned in exactly the right place. When heat denatures the protein, all of these interactions are disrupted simultaneously. The unfolded chains, now exposed and flexible, can form *new* intermolecular interactions with each other -- random hydrogen bonds and London forces between different protein chains. These random inter-chain interactions tangle the proteins into an insoluble, disordered aggregate (the solid, opaque egg white). When the egg cools, the proteins do not "remember" their original folded shape. The tangled network is now locked in place by its own new set of intermolecular forces. The original fold required a very specific sequence of interactions that cannot spontaneously reassemble from the disordered aggregate. This is why a boiled egg stays solid -- the denatured, tangled proteins have found a new, stable (though disordered) arrangement that cooling cannot undo.

## Chapter 6 (MULTI): Practice Questions, Question 2

**Question**: Both cellulose (the structural material in wood and cotton) and starch (the energy-storage molecule in potatoes) are polymers of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆). They are made of the same monomer. Yet cellulose is rigid and insoluble (you cannot digest it), while starch is soft and digestible. Using DEF-STR008 (polymer reasoning) and PRIM-STR005 (structure-to-property inference), explain how two polymers with the same monomer can have dramatically different properties. (Hint: the monomers are linked in different orientations, which changes the 3D shape of the chain, which changes the intermolecular forces between chains.)

**Model Answer**:

This question deploys **DEF-STR008 (Polymer reasoning)** from Chapter 2 -- reasoning about how chain architecture determines material properties -- combined with **PRIM-STR005 (Structure-to-property inference)** -- chaining from molecular structural features to macroscopic properties.

Using **DEF-STR008 (polymer reasoning)**, we start with the key structural fact: both cellulose and starch are polymers of glucose, but the glucose monomers are linked together in different orientations. In starch, the glucose units are connected by what chemists call alpha linkages -- the bonds between monomers are oriented in the same direction, producing chains that coil into helical (spiral) shapes. In cellulose, the glucose units are connected by beta linkages -- alternate monomers are flipped 180 degrees relative to their neighbors, producing chains that extend in straight, rigid ribbons.

Now we apply **PRIM-STR005 (structure-to-property inference)** to chain from this structural difference to the dramatic property differences. The straight chains of cellulose can pack tightly against each other in parallel arrays, like boards stacked in a lumber yard. This tight packing maximizes the contact area between chains, which maximizes the **hydrogen bonding** (using PRIM-STR004, IMF hierarchy) between hydroxyl (-OH) groups on adjacent chains. The result is a rigid, crystalline material with extremely strong inter-chain cohesion -- this is why wood is hard and cotton fiber is strong. These tightly packed, hydrogen-bonded sheets are also insoluble in water: the inter-chain hydrogen bonds are so extensive that water molecules cannot wedge between the chains to dissolve them.

Starch's helical chains, by contrast, cannot pack as tightly. The coiled shape creates more space between chains and fewer inter-chain hydrogen bonds. Starch is therefore softer, more amorphous, and more easily penetrated by water. Your digestive enzymes (biological catalysts, recalling DEF-CHG001) can access the alpha linkages in starch and break them, releasing glucose for energy. However, human digestive enzymes cannot break the beta linkages in cellulose -- we lack the specific enzyme (cellulase) needed for that particular bond orientation. This is why you can digest a potato (starch) but not a piece of wood (cellulose), even though both are made of the same monomer. Same monomer, different linkage orientation, different chain shape, different intermolecular forces, dramatically different properties. This is polymer reasoning and structure-to-property inference working together.

## Chapter 6 (MULTI): Practice Questions, Question 3

**Question**: In sickle cell disease, a single amino acid substitution in hemoglobin (one glutamic acid is replaced by one valine, out of 574 amino acids) causes hemoglobin molecules to aggregate into rigid fibers, distorting red blood cells into a sickle shape. Using PRIM-STR005 (structure-to-property inference) and PRIM-STR004 (IMF hierarchy), explain how a change in one monomer (amino acid) can change the IMF interactions of the protein surface and thereby change the macroscopic property (cell shape). Why does this illustrate the principle that structure determines function?

**Model Answer**:

This question combines **PRIM-STR005 (Structure-to-property inference)** -- chaining from structural features to macroscopic properties -- with **PRIM-STR004 (IMF hierarchy)** -- identifying which intermolecular forces are present and how they govern behavior. It also draws on **DEF-STR008 (Polymer reasoning)** since proteins are polymers of amino acid monomers.

The single amino acid substitution replaces glutamic acid with valine at position 6 of the beta chain. This is where **PRIM-STR004 (IMF hierarchy)** becomes critical. Glutamic acid has a **charged** (negatively charged, polar) side chain at physiological pH -- it carries a carboxylate group (COO⁻) on its surface. Valine, by contrast, has a **nonpolar** side chain -- a small hydrocarbon group (isopropyl). This swap changes the IMF profile of that specific spot on the hemoglobin surface from ionic/polar interactions (which are compatible with the surrounding aqueous environment) to London dispersion forces (which are incompatible with water and instead seek contact with other nonpolar surfaces).

Using **PRIM-STR005 (structure-to-property inference)**, we trace the consequences. The nonpolar valine patch on one hemoglobin molecule now seeks to minimize its contact with water by associating with complementary nonpolar patches on adjacent hemoglobin molecules. This is the same "like dissolves like" logic (DEF-STR004) that explains why oil droplets merge in water -- nonpolar surfaces aggregate to avoid the polar aqueous environment. In sickle cell hemoglobin, this nonpolar-nonpolar association causes hemoglobin molecules to stack into long, rigid fibers inside the red blood cell. These fibers distort the normally flexible, disc-shaped red blood cell into a rigid crescent or "sickle" shape.

The sickled cells cannot flow smoothly through narrow capillaries. They get stuck, blocking blood flow and causing pain, organ damage, and potentially life-threatening complications. All of this -- from blocked blood vessels to organ damage -- traces back to a single change in intermolecular forces at one position on one protein. One monomer change altered the IMF profile of the protein surface, which changed the protein-protein interactions, which changed the cell shape, which changed the organ function. This is the principle that structure determines function, demonstrated with devastating clarity: the smallest possible structural change (one amino acid out of 574) produces a profound macroscopic consequence because it changes the intermolecular forces at a critical location on the molecular surface.
