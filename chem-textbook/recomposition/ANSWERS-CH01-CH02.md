## Chapter 1 (COM): What Is Stuff Made Of?

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.1, Question 1

**Question**: A water quality report lists arsenic (As) as a contaminant. Look up arsenic on the periodic table. What is its atomic number? How many protons does every arsenic atom have?

**Model Answer**:

The reasoning move here is **Elemental Identity (PRIM-COM002)**: given an element's symbol, locate it on the periodic table and read its atomic number. Arsenic has the symbol As and sits at atomic number Z = 33 on the periodic table. This means every arsenic atom has exactly 33 protons in its nucleus.

This is a straightforward periodic table lookup. The atomic number is the single defining property of an element -- it tells you how many protons are in the nucleus, and that proton count is what makes arsenic arsenic. No matter where the arsenic atom came from, no matter what compound it is part of, no matter how many neutrons or electrons it has, if it has 33 protons, it is arsenic.

In the real-world context of a water quality report, this lookup is the first step in understanding the contaminant. Arsenic sits in period 4, group 15 of the periodic table, which places it among the metalloids. Knowing its position allows further reasoning about its properties and behavior -- but the entry point is always the atomic number.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.1, Question 2

**Question**: Two atoms are found in a sample. Atom A has 8 protons. Atom B has 8 protons and a different number of neutrons than Atom A. Are they the same element or different elements? How do you know?

**Model Answer**:

This question requires two reasoning moves working together. First, **Atomic Composition Analysis (PRIM-COM001)** tells us to examine the subatomic particles of each atom. Atom A has 8 protons; Atom B also has 8 protons. The neutron counts differ, but we note that fact and move on. Second, **Elemental Identity (PRIM-COM002)** tells us that the number of protons alone determines what element an atom is.

Both atoms have 8 protons, so both are oxygen. They are the same element. The different neutron counts mean they have different mass numbers and are therefore different **isotopes** of oxygen (DEF-COM001), but isotopes are still the same element. Oxygen-16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons) and oxygen-18 (8 protons, 10 neutrons) are both oxygen. They undergo the same chemical reactions, form the same compounds, and have the same electronegativity.

The key principle is that elemental identity depends on proton count and nothing else. Neutrons affect mass and nuclear stability, but not chemical identity. This is why isotopes behave identically in chemical reactions -- chemistry is governed by electrons, and electron configuration is determined by proton count.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.1, Question 3

**Question**: If someone told you they had discovered a new element with 6 protons, what would you tell them?

**Model Answer**:

Using **Elemental Identity (PRIM-COM002)**, we know that the number of protons uniquely determines which element an atom is. An atom with 6 protons is carbon -- always, without exception. Carbon was identified centuries ago and occupies a well-established position on the periodic table (period 2, group 14).

You would tell this person that they have not discovered a new element. They have found carbon. The periodic table is indexed by atomic number, and Z = 6 is already taken. There is no ambiguity: every atom with exactly 6 protons is carbon, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it has. If it has a different number of neutrons than common carbon-12, it might be a different isotope of carbon (such as carbon-13 or carbon-14), but it is still carbon.

A genuinely new element would need to have a proton count that does not already appear on the periodic table. As of now, elements with Z = 1 through Z = 118 have all been identified. Any new element would need to have Z = 119 or higher, and synthesizing such elements requires advanced particle accelerators -- not kitchen chemistry.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.1, Question 4

**Question**: A nutrition label says a food contains "iron." What is the atomic number of iron? Where on the periodic table would you find it?

**Model Answer**:

This is a direct application of **Elemental Identity (PRIM-COM002)**: given the name of an element, look it up on the periodic table. Iron has the symbol Fe (from the Latin *ferrum*) and an atomic number of Z = 26. This means every iron atom has 26 protons in its nucleus.

On the periodic table, iron is located in period 4, group 8. It sits in the block of transition metals -- the large central section of the table. Transition metals are characterized by their ability to form multiple types of ions and their roles as catalysts and structural materials. Iron's position among the transition metals tells you it is a metal with moderate electronegativity, multiple possible oxidation states (Fe2+ and Fe3+ are both common), and typical metallic properties like conductivity and malleability.

In the context of a nutrition label, the iron listed is the element with Z = 26. Your body needs iron because it is a critical component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The periodic table lookup is the starting point: Z = 26, symbol Fe, period 4, group 8, transition metal.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.2, Question 1

**Question**: Without looking at an electronegativity table, predict which element is more electronegative: oxygen or sulfur. Explain your reasoning using periodic trends.

**Model Answer**:

This question calls for **Periodic Position Reasoning (PRIM-COM003)** and **Electronegativity (DEF-COM005)**. Both oxygen and sulfur are in group 16 of the periodic table. Oxygen is in period 2; sulfur is in period 3. They are in the same column, with oxygen directly above sulfur.

The periodic trend for electronegativity down a group is clear: electronegativity decreases as you move down a column. This happens because atoms lower in a group have more electron shells between the nucleus and the outermost electrons. Those inner shells shield the outer electrons from the full pull of the nucleus, making the atom less effective at attracting shared electrons. Oxygen, being higher in group 16, has fewer shielding layers and a stronger nuclear pull on shared electrons.

Therefore, oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur. This prediction matches the measured values: oxygen has an electronegativity of 3.4, while sulfur's is about 2.6. The periodic trend -- electronegativity decreases down a group -- gives you the correct answer without needing to look up any numbers. This is the power of periodic position reasoning: position predicts properties.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.2, Question 2

**Question**: Calcium is in group 2 of the periodic table. How many valence electrons does it have? When it forms an ion, what charge would you predict?

**Model Answer**:

This question uses **Valence Electron Reasoning (PRIM-COM007)** and **Ion (DEF-COM002)**. Calcium is in group 2, so applying the valence electron rule for main-group elements, calcium has 2 valence electrons.

When calcium forms an ion, it will lose those 2 valence electrons. Metals in groups 1 and 2 achieve a stable electron configuration by losing their valence electrons rather than gaining 6 more. Losing 2 electrons gives calcium a full outer shell (matching the noble gas argon), and since it now has 2 more protons (20) than electrons (18), it carries a charge of +2. The predicted ion is Ca2+.

This prediction is confirmed by calcium's behavior in real life. Calcium appears as Ca2+ in bones and teeth (as part of calcium phosphate), in hard water (dissolved Ca2+ ions), and in calcium supplements (calcium carbonate contains Ca2+ ions paired with CO3 2- ions). The periodic table's group number gave us the valence electron count, and the octet rule told us what would happen to those electrons -- a clean chain from position to prediction.

---

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.2, Question 3

**Question**: Why do the noble gases (group 18) almost never form compounds with other elements?

**Model Answer**:

This is answered by **Valence Electron Reasoning (PRIM-COM007)**. Noble gases are in group 18, which means they have 8 valence electrons (except helium, which has 2). Eight valence electrons is a full outer shell -- the configuration that the octet rule says atoms "want" to achieve.

Atoms bond because they have incomplete valence shells. Metals lose electrons, nonmetals gain them, and elements in the middle share them -- all in pursuit of a full set of 8. But noble gases already have 8 valence electrons. They have no need to gain, lose, or share electrons with other atoms. Their valence shell is already complete, so there is no driving force for bonding.

This is why noble gases exist as isolated, individual atoms rather than as molecules. Neon signs glow because neon atoms remain as free atoms even when electricity excites them -- they emit light but do not combine with other atoms. Helium balloons float because helium is a light, unreactive gas that will not bond with the nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere. The full valence shell is the structural reason for their chemical inertness, and **Periodic Position Reasoning (PRIM-COM003)** confirms that group 18's position at the far right of the table corresponds to maximum stability.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.2, Question 4

**Question**: Phosphorus is in group 15. How many valence electrons does it have? How many more electrons would it need to satisfy the octet rule?

**Model Answer**:

Using **Valence Electron Reasoning (PRIM-COM007)**: phosphorus is in group 15. For main-group elements in groups 13-18, the number of valence electrons equals the group number minus 10. So phosphorus has 15 - 10 = 5 valence electrons.

To satisfy the octet rule, an atom needs 8 valence electrons. Phosphorus currently has 5, so it needs 8 - 5 = 3 more electrons. This means phosphorus will typically either gain 3 electrons (forming a P3- ion in ionic compounds) or share 3 electrons by forming 3 covalent bonds with other atoms.

In practice, phosphorus most commonly forms 3 bonds, which is consistent with needing 3 more electrons to reach an octet. For example, in phosphine (PH3), phosphorus forms 3 bonds to hydrogen atoms, using 3 of its 5 valence electrons for bonding and keeping the remaining 2 as a lone pair. This gives phosphorus a total of 8 electrons around it (3 bonding pairs + 1 lone pair = 8 electrons), satisfying the octet rule. The same reasoning explains why phosphorus appears in phosphate (PO4 3-), a polyatomic ion found in fertilizers, DNA, and ATP -- the energy currency of cells.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.2, Question 5

**Question**: Rank these elements from smallest to largest atomic size: Na, Mg, K. Explain your reasoning.

**Model Answer**:

This requires **Periodic Position Reasoning (PRIM-COM003)**, specifically the two periodic trends for atomic size. First, locate each element: sodium (Na) is in period 3, group 1; magnesium (Mg) is in period 3, group 2; potassium (K) is in period 4, group 1.

We apply two trends. Trend 1 (across a row): atoms get smaller from left to right because increasing nuclear charge pulls electrons closer. Na and Mg are in the same period (period 3), with Mg to the right of Na. Therefore, Mg is smaller than Na. Trend 2 (down a column): atoms get larger from top to bottom because each new period adds an electron shell. Na and K are in the same group (group 1), with K one period below Na. Therefore, K is larger than Na.

Combining these: Mg is smaller than Na (same period, Mg is further right), and Na is smaller than K (same group, K is further down). The ranking from smallest to largest is: **Mg < Na < K**. Magnesium is the smallest because it has the strongest effective nuclear pull on its electrons among the three. Potassium is the largest because it has an additional electron shell compared to sodium, and its outermost electrons are farther from the nucleus with more shielding.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.3, Question 1

**Question**: Classify each of the following as an element, compound, or mixture: (a) pure copper wire, (b) a cup of coffee, (c) carbon dioxide gas (CO2), (d) the nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere (N2), (e) brass (a blend of copper and zinc).

**Model Answer**:

This question is a direct application of **Substance Classification (PRIM-COM004)**, which uses a decision tree: Is the sample a single substance or multiple substances? If single, does it contain one type of atom or more than one?

**(a) Pure copper wire: Element.** Copper wire contains only copper atoms (Cu). One type of atom, not bonded to atoms of a different element. This fits the definition of an element.

**(b) A cup of coffee: Mixture.** Coffee is water combined with hundreds of dissolved compounds -- caffeine, chlorogenic acids, sugars, oils, and various flavor molecules. Multiple substances are physically mixed together but not chemically bonded to each other. You could theoretically separate them by physical means (distillation, filtration, chromatography).

**(c) Carbon dioxide gas (CO2): Compound.** CO2 contains two types of atoms -- carbon and oxygen -- chemically bonded in a fixed 1:2 ratio. Two or more types of atoms bonded in fixed ratios defines a compound.

**(d) Nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere (N2): Element.** Although nitrogen exists as a diatomic molecule (two nitrogen atoms bonded together), it still contains only one type of atom. N2 is a molecular form of the element nitrogen, just as O2 is a molecular form of oxygen.

**(e) Brass: Mixture.** Brass is an alloy -- a physical blend of copper and zinc metals. The two metals are mixed together but not chemically bonded in fixed ratios. Different brass formulations contain different proportions of copper and zinc, which is a hallmark of mixtures (variable composition) as opposed to compounds (fixed composition).

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.3, Question 2

**Question**: How many atoms of each element are in the formula Al2(CO3)3?

**Model Answer**:

This is a **Chemical Formula Reading (PRIM-COM005)** exercise. The formula Al2(CO3)3 contains parentheses, so we must apply the parenthetical multiplication rule: the subscript outside the parentheses multiplies everything inside.

Start by identifying the components. Outside the parentheses, we have Al2: 2 aluminum atoms. Inside the parentheses, we have CO3, and the subscript 3 outside multiplies the entire group. So we compute: C appears once inside the parentheses, multiplied by 3, giving 3 carbon atoms. O appears with subscript 3 inside the parentheses, multiplied by the outer subscript 3, giving 3 x 3 = 9 oxygen atoms.

The complete atom count is: **2 Al, 3 C, 9 O**. This compound is aluminum carbonate. To verify, we can check that the charges balance: Al3+ (aluminum forms a +3 cation) and CO3 2- (carbonate is a -2 polyatomic ion). Two Al3+ ions contribute +6 total charge; three CO3 2- ions contribute -6 total charge. The charges balance, confirming the formula makes chemical sense.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.3, Question 3

**Question**: A log weighing 5 kg is burned completely, leaving 0.3 kg of ash. Has matter been destroyed? Use conservation of atoms (PRIM-COM006) to explain where the "missing" mass went.

**Model Answer**:

No, matter has not been destroyed. This is a direct application of **Conservation of Atoms (PRIM-COM006)**: in any chemical reaction, atoms rearrange but are neither created nor destroyed. The total number of each type of atom before burning equals the total number after.

When a log burns, the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the wood combine with oxygen atoms from the surrounding air. The products are primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O), both of which are gases that escape into the atmosphere. The "missing" 4.7 kg (5.0 kg - 0.3 kg) has not vanished -- it left as gaseous products. If you could capture and weigh all the CO2, H2O, and other gases produced, plus the ash, and also account for the mass of oxygen consumed from the air, the total mass of products would equal the total mass of reactants.

The ash (0.3 kg) consists of the mineral atoms -- calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and others -- that were present in the wood but did not form volatile gaseous products. Every atom that was in the log is accounted for: some went into the atmosphere as gas, and some remained as ash. **PRIM-COM006** assures us that no atoms were created or destroyed. The appearance of "disappearing" mass is an illusion caused by not tracking the gaseous products.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.3, Question 4

**Question**: Decode the formula for aspirin: C9H8O4. How many total atoms are in one molecule?

**Model Answer**:

Using **Chemical Formula Reading (PRIM-COM005)**, we parse the formula C9H8O4 by reading each element symbol and its subscript. Carbon (C) has a subscript of 9: 9 carbon atoms. Hydrogen (H) has a subscript of 8: 8 hydrogen atoms. Oxygen (O) has a subscript of 4: 4 oxygen atoms.

The total number of atoms in one molecule of aspirin is 9 + 8 + 4 = **21 atoms**. This is a moderately complex organic molecule -- it contains three different elements arranged in a specific structure. The formula tells us the composition (what atoms and how many), but it does not tell us the structure (how those atoms are connected). Two different molecules could in principle have the formula C9H8O4 but be arranged differently, producing different substances with different properties -- a concept we will see formalized as isomer recognition in Chapter 2.

In everyday terms, aspirin is acetylsalicylic acid, one of the most widely used medications in the world. Every tablet contains billions of these 21-atom molecules. Reading its formula is the first step to understanding what it is made of, which is the foundation for understanding how it works in the body.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.3, Question 5

**Question**: Is orange juice an element, compound, or mixture? Explain your reasoning.

**Model Answer**:

Orange juice is a **mixture**. Applying **Substance Classification (PRIM-COM004)**, we ask: is this a single substance or multiple substances combined? Orange juice contains water (H2O), citric acid (C6H8O7), various sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose), vitamin C (ascorbic acid, C6H8O6), potassium ions, calcium ions, flavonoid compounds, pulp (cellulose fibers), and many other substances.

These components are physically mixed together, not chemically bonded into a single compound with a fixed ratio. You can separate some of them by physical means: filtering removes the pulp, and distillation could separate the water from the dissolved solutes. The fact that orange juice has variable composition -- different oranges produce juice with different sugar concentrations, different acidity levels, and different amounts of pulp -- is a hallmark of mixtures. Compounds, by contrast, always have fixed ratios of atoms.

Performing **Atomic Composition Analysis (PRIM-COM001)** on orange juice would reveal atoms of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, potassium, calcium, and others -- but they are distributed across many different compounds all mixed together. The classification as a mixture tells us that physical separation methods (filtration, evaporation, chromatography) are the appropriate tools for analyzing its components.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.4, Question 1

**Question**: Oxygen-16 and oxygen-18 are two isotopes of oxygen. How many protons and neutrons does each have? Would they behave differently in a chemical reaction?

**Model Answer**:

This question uses **Atomic Composition Analysis (PRIM-COM001)**, **Elemental Identity (PRIM-COM002)**, and the definition of **Isotope (DEF-COM001)**. Both are oxygen, which means both have Z = 8, so both have 8 protons. The mass number tells us the total of protons plus neutrons. For oxygen-16: neutrons = 16 - 8 = 8. For oxygen-18: neutrons = 18 - 8 = 10. So oxygen-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, while oxygen-18 has 8 protons and 10 neutrons.

Would they behave differently in a chemical reaction? No. According to the definition of isotope (DEF-COM001), isotopes of the same element have identical chemical behavior. Chemical reactions are governed by electrons, and electron configuration is determined by proton count (Z). Since both isotopes have Z = 8, they have the same electron configuration, the same electronegativity, and the same bonding behavior. They form the same compounds and undergo the same reactions.

The only differences are mass and nuclear stability. Oxygen-18 is slightly heavier, and scientists actually exploit this mass difference in paleoclimatology: the ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in ice cores reveals past temperatures, because water molecules containing the heavier isotope evaporate slightly less readily. But this is a physical property difference (mass), not a chemical behavior difference. In any chemical reaction, oxygen-16 and oxygen-18 are interchangeable.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.4, Question 2

**Question**: Predict the ion that magnesium (Mg, group 2) would form. What about bromine (Br, group 17)?

**Model Answer**:

This calls for **Valence Electron Reasoning (PRIM-COM007)** combined with the definition of **Ion (DEF-COM002)**.

**Magnesium (group 2):** Magnesium has 2 valence electrons. As a metal on the left side of the periodic table, it will lose those 2 electrons rather than gain 6 more. Losing 2 electrons gives magnesium 2 more protons than electrons, resulting in a charge of +2. Magnesium forms the cation **Mg2+**. This is consistent with the periodic table prediction: group 2 metals form +2 cations.

**Bromine (group 17):** Bromine has 7 valence electrons (17 - 10 = 7). As a nonmetal on the right side of the table, it is close to a full octet and will gain 1 electron rather than lose 7. Gaining 1 electron gives bromine 1 more electron than protons, resulting in a charge of -1. Bromine forms the anion **Br-**. This is consistent with the prediction: group 17 nonmetals form -1 anions.

The pattern is systematic: the periodic table position predicts whether an element gains or loses electrons and how many. Metals (left side) lose their few valence electrons to form cations. Nonmetals (right side) gain the few electrons needed to complete an octet to form anions. In practice, magnesium and bromine can combine to form magnesium bromide (MgBr2): one Mg2+ ion pairs with two Br- ions to achieve charge neutrality.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.4, Question 3

**Question**: A sample contains Na+ ions and Cl- ions. Is sodium still sodium even though it has lost an electron? Explain using the concept of elemental identity (PRIM-COM002).

**Model Answer**:

Yes, sodium is still sodium. **Elemental Identity (PRIM-COM002)** establishes that an element's identity is determined solely by its proton count (atomic number Z). Sodium has Z = 11, meaning it has 11 protons. When sodium loses an electron to become Na+, it still has 11 protons. The proton count has not changed; only the electron count has. Therefore, Na+ is still sodium.

Similarly, Cl- is still chlorine. Chlorine has Z = 17 (17 protons). Gaining an extra electron gives it 18 electrons, but the proton count remains 17. Chlorine's identity is unchanged.

This is a crucial distinction established by **PRIM-COM002**: identity depends on protons alone. Electrons can be gained or lost (creating ions, as described by **DEF-COM002**), and neutrons can vary (creating isotopes, as described by **DEF-COM001**), but neither of these changes alters which element the atom is. Na+ is a sodium ion -- it is sodium in a charged state, not a different element. The 11 protons in its nucleus are what make it sodium, and those protons are not affected by the loss of an electron. This is why we can say "table salt contains sodium and chlorine" even though the sodium and chlorine in NaCl are present as ions, not as neutral atoms.

---

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.4, Question 4

**Question**: What is the difference between an isotope and an ion? (Hint: one changes the neutron count, the other changes the electron count.)

**Model Answer**:

The distinction is cleanly defined by **Isotope (DEF-COM001)** and **Ion (DEF-COM002)**, both built on **Atomic Composition Analysis (PRIM-COM001)**.

An **isotope** is a variant of an element with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. The neutron count changes, which alters the atom's mass number but does not affect its chemical behavior. Carbon-12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and carbon-14 (6 protons, 8 neutrons) are isotopes. They are both carbon, they form the same bonds, and they participate in the same reactions. The difference is mass and, in the case of carbon-14, nuclear instability (radioactivity).

An **ion** is an atom (or group of atoms) that has gained or lost one or more electrons, giving it a net electrical charge. The electron count changes, which gives the atom a positive or negative charge but does not change what element it is. Na+ (11 protons, 10 electrons) is a sodium ion. It is still sodium because it still has 11 protons. The difference from neutral sodium is charge and reactivity -- ions behave differently from neutral atoms in their interactions with other charged particles.

In summary: isotopes differ in neutrons (different mass, same chemistry), while ions differ in electrons (different charge, same elemental identity). Neither change affects the proton count, so neither change alters which element the atom belongs to.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.4, Question 5

**Question**: Look at a sports drink label. What ions (electrolytes) are listed? Can you predict their charges from the periodic table?

**Model Answer**:

This question integrates **Chemical Formula Reading (PRIM-COM005)**, **Elemental Identity (PRIM-COM002)**, **Valence Electron Reasoning (PRIM-COM007)**, and **Ion (DEF-COM002)**. A typical sports drink label lists electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, and phosphate.

Using the periodic table to predict charges: Sodium (Na) is in group 1, so it has 1 valence electron and forms Na+ by losing it. Potassium (K) is also in group 1, forming K+. Calcium (Ca) is in group 2, so it has 2 valence electrons and forms Ca2+. Magnesium (Mg) is in group 2, forming Mg2+. Chlorine (Cl) is in group 17, with 7 valence electrons, gaining 1 to form Cl-. Phosphate (PO4 3-) is a polyatomic ion that does not follow the simple group-number rule but carries a -3 charge.

The periodic table successfully predicts the charges of all the monatomic ions listed. Group 1 metals form +1 cations, group 2 metals form +2 cations, and group 17 nonmetals form -1 anions. These ions are called "electrolytes" because when dissolved in water, they conduct electricity -- the charged particles carry current through the solution. Your body uses these ions for nerve signaling, muscle contraction, and maintaining fluid balance, which is why replacing them after sweating is important.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.5, Question 1

**Question**: Pick a product in your kitchen. Read its label. Choose one ingredient and try to build a causal chain: what does that ingredient do at the molecular level, and how does it lead to the product's advertised effect?

**Model Answer**:

This is an open-ended application of **Causal Chain Reasoning (PRIM-COM008)**. Here is a model answer using baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) as found in an antacid tablet.

**Claim**: "Baking soda relieves heartburn."

**Step 1 -- Molecular-level event**: Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) dissolves in the stomach fluid, releasing the bicarbonate ion (HCO3-). Using **Chemical Formula Reading (PRIM-COM005)**, we identify the atoms present: Na, H, C, O.

**Step 2 -- Mechanism**: The bicarbonate ion reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach. HCO3- + HCl produces H2O + CO2. The acid is consumed -- its H+ ions are neutralized by the bicarbonate.

**Step 3 -- Intermediate steps**: As stomach acid is neutralized, the pH of the stomach fluid rises (becomes less acidic). The reduced acidity lessens the chemical irritation of the esophageal lining that causes the burning sensation.

**Step 4 -- Macroscopic observation**: The person feels relief from heartburn. The burning sensation diminishes.

**Step 5 -- Is the chain complete?** Yes, every link is supported. The molecular event (acid-base reaction) leads through a clear mechanism (neutralization reduces acidity) to the observable effect (pain relief). The chain also explains the side effect: CO2 gas is produced, which is why taking baking soda for heartburn often causes burping. This is a well-supported causal chain with no missing links.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.5, Question 2

**Question**: A friend says "I only drink alkaline water because it neutralizes acid in your body." What steps would you need to verify in the causal chain before accepting this claim?

**Model Answer**:

Applying **Causal Chain Reasoning (PRIM-COM008)**, we decompose the claim "alkaline water neutralizes acid in your body" into its constituent links and check each one.

**Step 1 -- Molecular-level event**: Alkaline water has a pH slightly above 7, meaning it contains a small excess of OH- ions or dissolved minerals. Does this alkalinity survive contact with the highly acidic environment of the stomach (pH ~1.5-3.5)? The stomach produces hydrochloric acid. Any alkaline water would be immediately neutralized by stomach acid long before it could affect the pH of the rest of the body. This is a potential missing link: the molecular event (alkalinity) may not survive the first step in digestion.

**Step 2 -- Mechanism**: Even if some alkalinity reached the bloodstream, the body has powerful buffering systems (primarily the bicarbonate buffer system) that maintain blood pH in a very narrow range (7.35-7.45). Drinking slightly alkaline water would not measurably change blood pH because the buffers absorb the difference. This is a second missing link: the mechanism by which alkaline water would change body pH does not overcome the body's homeostatic controls.

**Step 3 -- Macroscopic observation**: What specific health outcome is claimed? "Neutralizes acid" is vague. The body is not uniformly acidic -- the stomach is supposed to be acidic; it needs acid to digest food.

**Conclusion**: The causal chain has at least two missing links. The claim that alkaline water "neutralizes acid in your body" is not supported by a complete chain from molecular event to health outcome. The stomach neutralizes the water's alkalinity, and the body's buffers prevent pH changes in the blood. This is an example of a claim that sounds plausible at the surface but collapses under causal chain analysis.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.5, Question 3

**Question**: When you hear "chemical X is toxic," what is the first question a causal chain analysis would ask?

**Model Answer**:

Using **Causal Chain Reasoning (PRIM-COM008)**, the first question is: **What is the molecular-level event?** Specifically: what does chemical X do at the level of atoms and molecules when it enters the body? What biological molecules does it interact with, and how?

This is Step 1 of the causal chain template. "Toxic" is a macroscopic claim -- it describes an observable outcome (harm to a living organism). But a complete causal chain requires tracing backward from the observable harm to the molecular cause. Does the chemical bind to an enzyme and block its function? Does it damage cell membranes? Does it disrupt DNA replication? Does it interfere with nerve signal transmission? Without identifying the molecular-level event, the claim "X is toxic" is just a label without an explanation.

A closely related follow-up question is: **at what dose?** Almost every substance is toxic at some dose and harmless at another. Water is toxic if you drink enough of it (water intoxication dilutes blood sodium). Oxygen is toxic at high pressures. The phrase "the dose makes the poison" is itself a causal chain insight: the molecular-level event may only occur at concentrations high enough to overwhelm the body's defenses. A complete causal chain analysis of any toxicity claim must specify the molecular mechanism and the dose at which it becomes relevant.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.E, Question 1

**Question**: What is the empirical formula of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)? What is n (the multiplier relating the empirical formula to the molecular formula)?

**Model Answer**:

This applies **Molecular vs. Empirical Formula (DEF-COM003)**, which depends on **Chemical Formula Reading (PRIM-COM005)**. The molecular formula of hydrogen peroxide is H2O2. To find the empirical formula, we divide all subscripts by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

The subscripts are 2 (for H) and 2 (for O). The GCD of 2 and 2 is 2. Dividing each subscript by 2: H(2/2)O(2/2) = H1O1 = **HO**. The empirical formula of hydrogen peroxide is HO.

The relationship between molecular and empirical formulas is: molecular formula = empirical formula x n. We have H2O2 = (HO) x n. Comparing subscripts: H2 = H1 x n, so n = 2. Checking with oxygen: O2 = O1 x n = O1 x 2 = O2. Confirmed: **n = 2**.

This means hydrogen peroxide has twice the atoms indicated by its simplest ratio. The empirical formula HO tells you the ratio (1:1 hydrogen to oxygen), but the molecular formula H2O2 tells you the actual count per molecule. This distinction matters because a different compound could share the empirical formula HO but have a different molecular formula and entirely different properties.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.E, Question 2

**Question**: Calculate the percent composition of carbon dioxide (CO2). Which element contributes more to the total mass?

**Model Answer**:

This uses **Percent Composition (DEF-COM004)**, built on **Chemical Formula Reading (PRIM-COM005)** and **Elemental Identity (PRIM-COM002)** for looking up atomic masses.

**Step 1 -- Identify atom counts**: CO2 contains 1 carbon atom and 2 oxygen atoms.

**Step 2 -- Look up atomic masses**: Carbon = 12.01 amu. Oxygen = 16.00 amu.

**Step 3 -- Calculate mass contributions**: Carbon: 1 x 12.01 = 12.01 amu. Oxygen: 2 x 16.00 = 32.00 amu.

**Step 4 -- Calculate total formula mass**: 12.01 + 32.00 = 44.01 amu.

**Step 5 -- Calculate percent by mass**: %C = (12.01 / 44.01) x 100% = 27.29%. %O = (32.00 / 44.01) x 100% = 72.71%.

**Step 6 -- Verify**: 27.29% + 72.71% = 100.00%. Check.

**Oxygen contributes more to the total mass** -- about 73% versus 27% for carbon. Even though there are only twice as many oxygen atoms as carbon atoms, oxygen is significantly heavier per atom (16.00 vs. 12.01 amu), and with two oxygen atoms per molecule, oxygen dominates the mass. This kind of calculation matters when tracking carbon emissions: a gallon of gasoline contains a certain mass of carbon, but the CO2 produced weighs much more than the carbon alone because each carbon atom picks up two heavy oxygen atoms from the air.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.E, Question 3

**Question**: Ribose (a sugar found in RNA) has the molecular formula C5H10O5. What is its empirical formula? Does it share this empirical formula with glucose (C6H12O6)?

**Model Answer**:

Using **Molecular vs. Empirical Formula (DEF-COM003)** and **Chemical Formula Reading (PRIM-COM005)**:

**Ribose (C5H10O5):** The subscripts are 5, 10, and 5. The GCD of 5, 10, and 5 is 5. Dividing each by 5: C(5/5)H(10/5)O(5/5) = C1H2O1 = **CH2O**. The empirical formula of ribose is CH2O, with n = 5.

**Glucose (C6H12O6):** The subscripts are 6, 12, and 6. The GCD of 6, 12, and 6 is 6. Dividing each by 6: C(6/6)H(12/6)O(6/6) = C1H2O1 = **CH2O**. The empirical formula of glucose is also CH2O, with n = 6.

**Yes, ribose and glucose share the same empirical formula: CH2O.** This means they have the same ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms (1:2:1), even though they have different molecular formulas and different actual atom counts. Ribose has 5 of each "CH2O unit," while glucose has 6.

This is a powerful demonstration of why the empirical formula alone is insufficient to identify a substance. CH2O is also the empirical formula of formaldehyde (molecular formula CH2O, n = 1) and acetic acid (molecular formula C2H4O2, n = 2). Four completely different substances -- a toxic preservative, a vinegar component, a sugar in RNA, and a sugar your body burns for energy -- all share the same simplest ratio. You need the molecular formula (and ultimately the structure) to distinguish them.

### Chapter 1 (COM): Section 1.E, Question 4

**Question**: A calcium supplement contains calcium citrate: Ca3(C6H5O7)2. Without doing a full calculation, would you expect the percent calcium to be higher or lower than in calcium carbonate (CaCO3)? Why?

**Model Answer**:

This requires **Percent Composition (DEF-COM004)** reasoning applied qualitatively, along with **Chemical Formula Reading (PRIM-COM005)** to count atoms.

First, let us read the formulas. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) contains 1 Ca, 1 C, and 3 O. Its formula mass is approximately 40 + 12 + 48 = 100 amu, and calcium contributes about 40 out of 100, or roughly 40%.

Calcium citrate, Ca3(C6H5O7)2, is a much larger formula unit. It contains 3 Ca atoms (contributing 3 x 40 = 120 amu of calcium), but the citrate portion is enormous: 2 x (6C + 5H + 7O) = 12 C + 10 H + 14 O. The non-calcium mass is 12(12) + 10(1) + 14(16) = 144 + 10 + 224 = 378 amu. The total formula mass is approximately 120 + 378 = 498 amu. The percent calcium is roughly 120/498 x 100% = about 24%.

Even without doing the full calculation, you can reason qualitatively: calcium citrate has a much larger, heavier organic anion (citrate, C6H5O7 3-) compared to the small carbonate anion (CO3 2-). All those extra carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms add mass to the formula without adding calcium. Therefore, **the percent calcium in calcium citrate is lower than in calcium carbonate.** The chapter text notes that calcium citrate is about 21% calcium versus 40% for calcium carbonate. This means you need a larger pill of calcium citrate to deliver the same amount of actual calcium -- a direct practical consequence of percent composition reasoning.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.1, Question 1

**Question**: Draw the Lewis structure for hydrogen chloride (HCl). How many lone pairs are on the chlorine atom?

**Model Answer**:

This uses **Lewis Structure (DEF-STR001)**, which depends on **Valence Electron Reasoning (PRIM-COM007)** from Chapter 1.

**Step 1 -- Count total valence electrons.** Hydrogen is in group 1: 1 valence electron. Chlorine is in group 17: 7 valence electrons. Total = 1 + 7 = 8.

**Step 2 -- Connect atoms with a single bond.** H--Cl. This uses 2 electrons (one bonding pair).

**Step 3 -- Distribute remaining electrons as lone pairs.** 8 - 2 = 6 remaining electrons. Place them as 3 lone pairs on chlorine. Hydrogen only needs a duet (2 electrons), which it already has from the bond. Chlorine now has 1 bonding pair + 3 lone pairs = 8 electrons, satisfying its octet.

**Step 4 -- Check octets.** H has 2 (duet satisfied). Cl has 8 (octet satisfied). Done.

The Lewis structure shows H--Cl with **3 lone pairs on chlorine**. This structure also tells us that HCl has only one bond and no opportunity for a symmetric geometry, so we can already anticipate that HCl will be a polar molecule -- the chlorine end will be delta-minus and the hydrogen end delta-plus, as confirmed by **Bond Polarity Reasoning (PRIM-STR002)** using chlorine's higher electronegativity (3.2 vs. 2.2 for hydrogen).

---

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.1, Question 2

**Question**: Draw the Lewis structure for methane (CH4). Does the carbon atom have any lone pairs?

**Model Answer**:

Applying **Lewis Structure (DEF-STR001)** with electron counts from **Valence Electron Reasoning (PRIM-COM007)**:

**Step 1 -- Count total valence electrons.** Carbon is in group 14: 4 valence electrons. Each hydrogen is in group 1: 1 valence electron each. Total = 4 + 4(1) = 8.

**Step 2 -- Connect atoms with single bonds.** Carbon is the central atom (hydrogen is always on the outside). Four C--H single bonds use 4 x 2 = 8 electrons.

**Step 3 -- Distribute remaining electrons.** 8 - 8 = 0 remaining electrons. There are no electrons left to distribute as lone pairs.

**Step 4 -- Check octets.** Carbon has 4 bonding pairs = 8 electrons (octet satisfied). Each hydrogen has 1 bonding pair = 2 electrons (duet satisfied). Done.

**No, carbon does not have any lone pairs in methane.** All four of carbon's valence electrons are used in bonding. This is characteristic of carbon in group 14: with 4 valence electrons, carbon forms exactly 4 bonds and typically has no lone pairs. The absence of lone pairs is structurally significant -- it means methane adopts a perfectly symmetric tetrahedral geometry with bond angles of 109.5 degrees, as predicted by **Molecular Shape Reasoning (PRIM-STR003)**. Since there are no lone pairs to create asymmetry, methane is nonpolar.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.1, Question 3

**Question**: Calculate the electronegativity difference for each bond and classify it: (a) H--F, (b) C--Cl, (c) K--Br, (d) N--O.

**Model Answer**:

This is a direct application of **Bond Type Classification (PRIM-STR001)**, which uses electronegativity values from **Electronegativity (DEF-COM005)**. The classification thresholds are: less than 0.4 = nonpolar covalent; 0.4 to 1.7 = polar covalent; greater than 1.7 = ionic.

**(a) H--F:** EN(F) = 4.0, EN(H) = 2.2. Delta-EN = |4.0 - 2.2| = 1.8. Since 1.8 > 1.7, this bond is classified as **ionic** (though it is borderline -- HF is often treated as a very polar covalent molecule in practice, illustrating that the thresholds are guidelines, not rigid boundaries).

**(b) C--Cl:** EN(Cl) = 3.2, EN(C) = 2.6. Delta-EN = |3.2 - 2.6| = 0.6. Since 0.4 < 0.6 < 1.7, this bond is **polar covalent**.

**(c) K--Br:** EN(Br) is approximately 3.0, EN(K) = 0.8. Delta-EN = |3.0 - 0.8| = 2.2. Since 2.2 > 1.7, this bond is **ionic**. This is consistent with KBr being an ionic compound (potassium bromide) that forms a crystal lattice and dissolves in water.

**(d) N--O:** EN(O) = 3.4, EN(N) = 3.0. Delta-EN = |3.4 - 3.0| = 0.4. Since delta-EN = 0.4, this sits right at the boundary and is classified as **nonpolar covalent** (borderline polar). In practice, N--O bonds are often considered slightly polar, but the difference is small.

---

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.1, Question 4

**Question**: Why is the bond in O2 classified as nonpolar covalent? Use the concept of electronegativity difference.

**Model Answer**:

This is explained by **Bond Type Classification (PRIM-STR001)**. In O2, both atoms are oxygen. Since they are the same element, they have identical electronegativities: EN(O) = 3.4 for both atoms. The electronegativity difference is delta-EN = |3.4 - 3.4| = 0.

A delta-EN of 0 means the electrons are shared perfectly equally between the two atoms. Neither atom pulls the shared electrons more strongly than the other. There is no partial charge separation, no delta-plus or delta-minus end, and no bond dipole. This is the definition of a **nonpolar covalent bond**.

This principle applies to all diatomic molecules made of the same element: N2 (delta-EN = 0), Cl2 (delta-EN = 0), H2 (delta-EN = 0). When identical atoms share electrons, the sharing is perfectly symmetric. This is the purest form of covalent bonding -- equal partnership with no charge imbalance. It is also why these diatomic molecules are nonpolar overall: if the only bond in the molecule has no dipole, the molecule has no net dipole.

---

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.1, Question 5

**Question**: A molecule contains a C=O bond and a C--H bond. Which bond is more polar? How do you know?

**Model Answer**:

Using **Bond Polarity Reasoning (PRIM-STR002)** and **Electronegativity (DEF-COM005)**, we compare the electronegativity differences:

**C=O bond:** EN(O) = 3.4, EN(C) = 2.6. Delta-EN = |3.4 - 2.6| = 0.8. This is a polar covalent bond with significant partial charge separation.

**C--H bond:** EN(C) = 2.6, EN(H) = 2.2. Delta-EN = |2.6 - 2.2| = 0.4. This is at the borderline of nonpolar/polar covalent, with very little partial charge separation.

The **C=O bond is more polar** because its electronegativity difference (0.8) is larger than that of the C--H bond (0.4). A larger delta-EN means a greater separation of partial charges: the oxygen end of the C=O bond is more strongly delta-minus, and the carbon end is more strongly delta-plus, compared to the very weak charge separation in a C--H bond.

This difference matters for molecular polarity. In a molecule like formaldehyde (CH2O), the C=O bond creates a significant dipole, while the C--H bonds contribute very little. The net molecular dipole is dominated by the C=O bond, making formaldehyde a polar molecule. This polarity is why formaldehyde dissolves in water and is reactive -- properties that trace back to the electronegativity difference in the C=O bond.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.2, Question 1

**Question**: Draw the Lewis structure of hydrogen fluoride (HF). Label the delta-plus and delta-minus ends of the bond. Is the molecule polar or nonpolar?

**Model Answer**:

We apply **Lewis Structure (DEF-STR001)**, **Bond Polarity Reasoning (PRIM-STR002)**, and **Molecular Polarity (DEF-STR002)**.

**Lewis structure:** H has 1 valence electron (group 1). F has 7 valence electrons (group 17). Total = 8. Connect H--F with a single bond (uses 2 electrons). Remaining: 6 electrons = 3 lone pairs, all placed on fluorine. F now has 1 bonding pair + 3 lone pairs = 8 (octet). H has 1 bonding pair = 2 (duet). Done.

**Bond polarity:** Fluorine (EN = 4.0) is far more electronegative than hydrogen (EN = 2.2). Delta-EN = 1.8. The shared electrons are pulled strongly toward fluorine. The fluorine end is **delta-minus** and the hydrogen end is **delta-plus**:

delta+ H --- F delta-

**Molecular polarity:** HF is a diatomic molecule with only one bond. There is no possibility for bond dipoles to cancel -- there is only one dipole. Therefore HF is unambiguously **polar**. The net dipole points from hydrogen toward fluorine.

This polarity has real-world consequences: HF dissolves readily in water (polar dissolves in polar), and the highly polar H--F bond makes HF capable of hydrogen bonding -- hydrogen is bonded to fluorine, which is in the N/O/F group required for hydrogen bonding (**DEF-STR003**). HF's strong polarity and hydrogen bonding ability make it a particularly aggressive acid.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.2, Question 2

**Question**: Predict the molecular geometry of boron trifluoride (BF3). The boron atom has 3 bonds and 0 lone pairs. Is BF3 polar or nonpolar?

**Model Answer**:

This uses **Molecular Shape Reasoning (PRIM-STR003)** and **Molecular Polarity (DEF-STR002)**.

**Shape prediction:** Boron is the central atom with 3 bonding groups and 0 lone pairs. Total electron groups = 3. According to the VSEPR model, 3 electron groups with 0 lone pairs produces a **trigonal planar** geometry with bond angles of 120 degrees. The three fluorine atoms are equally spaced around the boron in a flat, triangular arrangement.

**Polarity determination:** Each B--F bond is polar (fluorine is much more electronegative than boron). However, the trigonal planar geometry is perfectly symmetric. The three bond dipoles point outward from boron toward each fluorine at 120-degree angles. When you add these three equal dipole vectors, they cancel perfectly (each dipole is offset by the other two in the opposite direction). The net dipole is zero.

Therefore, BF3 is **nonpolar** despite having three polar bonds. This is the same principle at work as in CO2: symmetric geometry causes polar bond dipoles to cancel. The key reasoning move from **DEF-STR002** is that molecular polarity depends on both bond polarity and geometry. A molecule can have polar bonds but still be nonpolar overall if the geometry produces cancellation. BF3 is a textbook example of this principle -- three identical polar bonds in a symmetric arrangement produce zero net polarity.

---

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.2, Question 3

**Question**: Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) has four polar C--Cl bonds arranged in a tetrahedral shape. Explain why the molecule is nonpolar despite having polar bonds.

**Model Answer**:

This is a direct application of **Molecular Polarity (DEF-STR002)**, combining **Bond Polarity Reasoning (PRIM-STR002)** with **Molecular Shape Reasoning (PRIM-STR003)**.

Each C--Cl bond is polar. Chlorine (EN = 3.2) is more electronegative than carbon (EN = 2.6), giving delta-EN = 0.6. Each bond has a dipole pointing from carbon (delta+) toward chlorine (delta-). So there are four bond dipoles, each pulling electron density toward a chlorine atom.

However, the four chlorine atoms are arranged in a **tetrahedral** geometry -- equally spaced in three dimensions at 109.5-degree angles. This is a perfectly symmetric arrangement. Each C--Cl dipole vector is exactly counterbalanced by the combined effect of the other three. Think of it as a tug-of-war with four equally strong ropes pulling in perfectly balanced directions: no team wins, so the net pull is zero.

The vector sum of all four bond dipoles is zero. Because the net dipole is zero, CCl4 is **nonpolar**. This is why carbon tetrachloride does not dissolve in water (a polar solvent) but does dissolve in nonpolar solvents like hexane. It is also why CCl4 was historically used as a dry-cleaning solvent and degreaser -- its nonpolarity makes it effective at dissolving nonpolar substances like grease and oils. The lesson is that symmetry, not individual bond polarity, determines molecular polarity.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.2, Question 4

**Question**: Sulfur dioxide (SO2) has a bent shape with 2 bonds and 1 lone pair on sulfur. Is SO2 polar or nonpolar? Explain.

**Model Answer**:

Using **Molecular Shape Reasoning (PRIM-STR003)** and **Molecular Polarity (DEF-STR002)**:

**Shape:** Sulfur is the central atom with 2 bonding groups (the two oxygen atoms) and 1 lone pair. Total electron groups = 3, giving a trigonal planar electron geometry. But the molecular geometry (atoms only) is **bent**, because one of the three electron group positions is occupied by an invisible lone pair rather than an atom. The bond angle is approximately 117 degrees.

**Bond polarity:** Each S=O bond is polar. Oxygen (EN = 3.4) is more electronegative than sulfur (EN approximately 2.6), so each bond dipole points from sulfur toward oxygen.

**Molecular polarity:** Because the molecule is bent, the two S=O bond dipoles do not point in exactly opposite directions. Instead, they are angled toward each other (like the two hands of a clock at about 10 and 2). Their vector sum does not cancel -- there is a net dipole pointing away from the sulfur and toward the "open" side of the molecule where both oxygen atoms sit.

Therefore, SO2 is **polar**. The bent geometry prevents the bond dipoles from canceling, just as in water. If SO2 were linear (which it is not, because of the lone pair), the dipoles would cancel and it would be nonpolar like CO2. The lone pair creates the geometric asymmetry that produces a net dipole. This is a clear example of how lone pairs on the central atom change the shape and thereby change the polarity -- the critical link between steps 3 and 4 in the reasoning chain.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.2, Question 5

**Question**: Predict whether each molecule is polar or nonpolar: (a) HCl, (b) N2, (c) CHCl3 (one H and three Cl around a central C).

**Model Answer**:

For each molecule, we apply **Bond Polarity Reasoning (PRIM-STR002)**, **Molecular Shape Reasoning (PRIM-STR003)**, and **Molecular Polarity (DEF-STR002)**.

**(a) HCl: Polar.** HCl is a diatomic molecule with one polar bond (delta-EN = |3.2 - 2.2| = 1.0). With only one bond, there are no other dipoles to cancel it. The molecule has a net dipole pointing from H (delta+) toward Cl (delta-). HCl is **polar**.

**(b) N2: Nonpolar.** N2 is a diatomic molecule composed of two identical nitrogen atoms. The electronegativity difference is |3.0 - 3.0| = 0. The bond is nonpolar covalent with no dipole whatsoever. N2 is **nonpolar**. This is why nitrogen gas is inert enough to make up 78% of the atmosphere without reacting with most things at ordinary temperatures.

**(c) CHCl3 (chloroform): Polar.** Carbon is the central atom with 4 bonding groups and 0 lone pairs, giving a tetrahedral electron geometry. However, the four attached atoms are NOT all the same: one is hydrogen and three are chlorine. The three C--Cl bonds are strongly polar (delta-EN = 0.6 each), all pulling toward chlorine. The one C--H bond is nearly nonpolar (delta-EN = 0.4). Because the four substituents are not identical, the geometry is not truly symmetric. The three C--Cl dipoles pull strongly toward the chlorine side, while the single C--H dipole provides only weak opposition from the hydrogen side. The net dipole is nonzero, pointing from the hydrogen end toward the three-chlorine end. CHCl3 is **polar**. Compare this to CCl4, where four identical C--Cl bonds in a symmetric tetrahedron cancel perfectly. Replacing one Cl with H breaks the symmetry and creates a net dipole.

---

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.3, Question 1

**Question**: Which type of IMF is present in ALL molecules, whether polar or nonpolar?

**Model Answer**:

Using the **Intermolecular Force Hierarchy (PRIM-STR004)**, the answer is **London dispersion forces** (also called van der Waals forces).

London dispersion forces arise from temporary, random fluctuations in electron distribution. At any instant, the electrons in a molecule may be unevenly distributed, creating a momentary dipole. This temporary dipole induces a complementary dipole in a neighboring molecule, producing a brief attraction. These fluctuations happen constantly and in all molecules -- every substance with electrons experiences them.

The critical principle from the IMF hierarchy is: London dispersion forces are always present. They are the baseline intermolecular force. For nonpolar molecules like methane (CH4) or oxygen gas (O2), London forces are the only IMF present. For polar molecules, London forces exist in addition to dipole-dipole forces. For molecules capable of hydrogen bonding, London forces exist alongside both dipole-dipole forces and hydrogen bonds. London forces are individually the weakest type of IMF, but they are universal -- no molecule is exempt.

The strength of London forces depends on molecular size: more electrons and more surface area mean stronger London forces. This is why large nonpolar molecules like cooking oil are liquids at room temperature (strong London forces from large molecular size), while small nonpolar molecules like methane are gases (weak London forces from small molecular size).

---

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.3, Question 2

**Question**: Explain why water (H2O, molar mass 18) has a much higher boiling point than methane (CH4, molar mass 16), even though they are similar in size.

**Model Answer**:

This is a classic application of the **Intermolecular Force Hierarchy (PRIM-STR004)** and **Structure-to-Property Inference (PRIM-STR005)**.

Methane (CH4) is a nonpolar molecule. Its only intermolecular forces are London dispersion forces, which are very weak for such a small molecule. These weak IMFs are easily overcome by thermal kinetic energy, which is why methane is a gas at room temperature (boiling point: -161 degrees C).

Water (H2O), despite being nearly the same size as methane, has dramatically different IMFs. Water is polar (bent geometry means bond dipoles do not cancel, as established by **DEF-STR002**), so it has dipole-dipole forces. More importantly, water has O--H bonds, which means it can form **hydrogen bonds** (**DEF-STR003**). Each water molecule can form up to 4 hydrogen bonds -- 2 through its hydrogen atoms (as donors) and 2 through its oxygen lone pairs (as acceptors). This creates an extensive hydrogen bonding network.

Hydrogen bonds are roughly 10 times stronger than ordinary dipole-dipole interactions and far stronger than London forces for molecules of this size. Overcoming this dense hydrogen bonding network requires much more thermal energy. The result: water boils at 100 degrees C, a full 261 degrees higher than methane.

The lesson from **PRIM-STR005** is clear: similar size does not mean similar boiling point. The type and strength of IMFs -- not molecular mass -- determine boiling point. Water's hydrogen bonding capability gives it anomalously high boiling point for its size, which is why water is a liquid on Earth's surface rather than a gas.

---

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.3, Question 3

**Question**: Rank these substances from lowest to highest boiling point: NaCl, CH4, C2H5OH. Explain your reasoning using the IMF hierarchy.

**Model Answer**:

Applying the **Intermolecular Force Hierarchy (PRIM-STR004)** and **Structure-to-Property Inference (PRIM-STR005)**:

**CH4 (methane):** Nonpolar molecule. Only IMF is London dispersion forces, which are very weak for this small molecule. Predicted boiling point: very low. Actual: -161 degrees C.

**C2H5OH (ethanol):** Polar molecule with an O--H group. IMFs include London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole forces, and hydrogen bonding (**DEF-STR003** -- H bonded to O satisfies the hydrogen bonding criteria). Hydrogen bonding is much stronger than London forces alone. Predicted boiling point: moderate. Actual: 78 degrees C.

**NaCl (sodium chloride):** Ionic compound. The dominant interaction is ionic (full positive Na+ and negative Cl- charges attracting each other). Ionic interactions are the strongest type on the IMF ladder -- far stronger than hydrogen bonding. Predicted boiling point: very high. Actual: 1,413 degrees C.

**Ranking from lowest to highest boiling point: CH4 < C2H5OH < NaCl.**

The ranking follows the IMF hierarchy exactly: London only (weakest) < hydrogen bonding (moderate) < ionic (strongest). Stronger intermolecular forces require more thermal energy to overcome, resulting in higher boiling points. This three-substance comparison beautifully illustrates the entire IMF ladder in action, from the weakest to the strongest interactions.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.3, Question 4

**Question**: Butane (C4H10) is a gas at room temperature. Decane (C10H22) is a liquid. Both are nonpolar hydrocarbons with only London dispersion forces. Why does decane have a higher boiling point?

**Model Answer**:

This is explained by the **Intermolecular Force Hierarchy (PRIM-STR004)** and **Structure-to-Property Inference (PRIM-STR005)**, specifically the size-dependence of London dispersion forces, combined with **Carbon Backbone Reasoning (DEF-STR007)**.

Both butane and decane are nonpolar hydrocarbons composed entirely of C--H and C--C bonds. Their only intermolecular forces are London dispersion forces. However, London forces are not the same strength for all molecules -- they increase with molecular size. Larger molecules have more electrons and more surface area over which temporary dipoles can form and interact.

Decane (C10H22, 10 carbons) is more than twice the length of butane (C4H10, 4 carbons). Decane has more electrons (total of 72 electrons vs. 34 for butane) and a much larger surface area. When decane molecules lie alongside each other, there is extensive surface contact for London force interactions. Butane molecules, being shorter, have less contact area and fewer electrons, resulting in weaker London forces.

Stronger London forces in decane mean more energy is needed to pull the molecules apart into the gas phase. Therefore, decane has a higher boiling point (174 degrees C) compared to butane (-1 degrees C), and decane is a liquid at room temperature while butane is a gas. This same trend extends across all hydrocarbons: as chain length increases, London forces increase, and boiling point rises. It is why gasoline (short chains) is a volatile liquid while paraffin wax (long chains) is a solid.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.3, Question 5

**Question**: Is the following statement true or false? "When water boils, the covalent O--H bonds break." Explain.

**Model Answer**:

This statement is **false**. This is a critical distinction addressed by the **Intermolecular Force Hierarchy (PRIM-STR004)** and **Phase from IMF Balance (DEF-STR006)**.

When water boils, the **intermolecular forces** between water molecules are overcome -- specifically, the hydrogen bonds and dipole-dipole interactions that hold separate H2O molecules near each other. The water molecules are pulled apart from each other, transitioning from liquid (molecules close together, sliding past each other) to gas (molecules far apart, moving independently). But each individual water molecule remains intact. The H2O molecules in steam are the same H2O molecules that were in the liquid water.

The **intramolecular** O--H covalent bonds within each water molecule are NOT broken during boiling. Breaking O--H covalent bonds would mean destroying the water molecules themselves -- splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen atoms or ions. This requires far more energy than boiling. A typical O--H covalent bond has an energy of about 460 kJ/mol, while a typical hydrogen bond between water molecules is only about 20 kJ/mol. Boiling provides enough energy to overcome the weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds but nowhere near enough to break the strong intramolecular covalent bonds.

Confusing intramolecular bonds with intermolecular forces is one of the most common errors in introductory chemistry. The rule is: phase changes (melting, boiling, evaporating) break intermolecular forces. Chemical reactions break intramolecular bonds. Boiling is a phase change, not a chemical reaction.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.4, Question 1

**Question**: Predict whether ethanol (C2H5OH) is more soluble in water or in hexane (C6H14). Explain using "like dissolves like."

**Model Answer**:

This uses **"Like Dissolves Like" (DEF-STR004)**, which depends on **Molecular Polarity (DEF-STR002)**.

First, classify each substance's polarity. Water (H2O) is polar, with extensive hydrogen bonding capability. Hexane (C6H14) is a nonpolar hydrocarbon -- all C--H and C--C bonds with no significant dipole.

Now examine ethanol (C2H5OH). Ethanol has a short nonpolar carbon chain (C2H5-) and a polar hydroxyl group (-OH). The -OH group is polar and can form hydrogen bonds with water (H bonded to O satisfies **DEF-STR003**). The polar -OH group gives ethanol favorable interactions with polar water molecules.

Applying "like dissolves like": ethanol's polar -OH group makes it compatible with polar water. The nonpolar carbon chain is short enough (only 2 carbons) that it does not overwhelm the polar character. Ethanol is **more soluble in water** than in hexane. In fact, ethanol and water are miscible in all proportions -- they mix completely regardless of ratio.

While ethanol does have a nonpolar portion that could interact with hexane through London forces, its dominant character is polar due to the -OH group. The strong hydrogen bonding between ethanol and water molecules (replacing ethanol-ethanol and water-water hydrogen bonds) makes dissolution favorable. This is why alcoholic beverages are water-based solutions -- the ethanol dissolves readily in water.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.4, Question 2

**Question**: Motor oil is a mixture of long nonpolar hydrocarbons. Why does it not wash off your hands with water alone?

**Model Answer**:

This is explained by **"Like Dissolves Like" (DEF-STR004)** and **Structure-to-Property Inference (PRIM-STR005)**.

Motor oil consists of long-chain hydrocarbons -- molecules built from C--C and C--H bonds with no polar functional groups. Using **Bond Type Classification (PRIM-STR001)**, C--H bonds have delta-EN = 0.4 (essentially nonpolar) and C--C bonds have delta-EN = 0 (perfectly nonpolar). Motor oil is therefore a nonpolar substance whose only intermolecular forces are London dispersion forces.

Water is polar, with strong hydrogen bonding. When you try to wash motor oil off your hands with water, you are attempting to mix a nonpolar solute with a polar solvent. "Like dissolves like" predicts this will fail: the nonpolar oil molecules cannot form favorable interactions with the polar water molecules. Water molecules prefer to hydrogen-bond with each other rather than interact with the nonpolar hydrocarbon chains. The oil is effectively excluded from the water.

This is why you need soap. As described by **PRIM-STR005**, soap molecules have a dual nature: a polar ionic head (which interacts with water) and a long nonpolar hydrocarbon tail (which interacts with the oil through London forces). Soap bridges the polarity gap, surrounding oil droplets in micelles with nonpolar tails pointing inward (toward the oil) and polar heads pointing outward (toward the water). The micelles are then carried away by the rinse water. Without this molecular bridge, polar water simply cannot interact with nonpolar oil.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.4, Question 3

**Question**: Why does sugar dissolve in water but wax does not? Both are composed of C, H, and O atoms.

**Model Answer**:

This question perfectly illustrates the central theme of Chapter 2: **composition alone does not determine properties; structure does.** We apply **"Like Dissolves Like" (DEF-STR004)** and **Structure-to-Property Inference (PRIM-STR005)**.

Sugar (sucrose, C12H22O11) and wax (a mixture of long-chain hydrocarbons, roughly C25H52) are both made of C, H, and O (though wax often contains little to no oxygen). Same elements, but vastly different structural arrangements.

Sugar molecules contain many -OH (hydroxyl) groups. Using **Bond Polarity Reasoning (PRIM-STR002)**, each O--H bond is polar (delta-EN = 1.2). These polar groups give sugar the ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules (**DEF-STR003**). Sugar is a polar molecule that interacts favorably with polar water. "Like dissolves like" predicts: polar sugar dissolves in polar water. Correct.

Wax molecules are long hydrocarbon chains with predominantly C--H and C--C bonds -- essentially nonpolar. Wax has no -OH groups, no polar functional groups, and no hydrogen bonding capability. It cannot interact favorably with water. "Like dissolves like" predicts: nonpolar wax does not dissolve in polar water. Correct.

The critical difference is not the elemental composition (both contain C, H, and O) but the structural arrangement: sugar has many polar O--H groups that enable interaction with water, while wax has only nonpolar C--H chains that cannot. This is why structure determines solubility -- and why Chapter 2 exists as a separate domain from Chapter 1.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.4, Question 4

**Question**: Using the structure-to-property chain, explain why propane (C3H8) is a gas at room temperature while propanol (C3H7OH) is a liquid.

**Model Answer**:

This is the full **Structure-to-Property Inference (PRIM-STR005)** chain in action:

**Propane (C3H8):**
1. **Lewis structure / Bond type (DEF-STR001, PRIM-STR001):** All C--H and C--C bonds, all nonpolar covalent.
2. **Molecular polarity (DEF-STR002):** No polar bonds of significance, so the molecule is nonpolar overall.
3. **IMF hierarchy (PRIM-STR004):** Nonpolar molecule = London dispersion forces only. Small molecule (only 3 carbons) = weak London forces.
4. **Phase prediction (DEF-STR006):** Weak IMFs mean kinetic energy at room temperature easily overcomes them. Propane is a **gas** (boiling point: -42 degrees C).

**Propanol (C3H7OH):**
1. **Lewis structure / Bond type:** Has C--H and C--C bonds (nonpolar), but also an O--H bond (polar, delta-EN = 1.2) and a C--O bond (polar, delta-EN = 0.8).
2. **Molecular polarity:** The -OH group creates a significant dipole. The molecule is polar.
3. **IMF hierarchy:** Polar molecule with an O--H group = hydrogen bonding (**DEF-STR003**) + dipole-dipole + London forces. Hydrogen bonding is much stronger than London forces alone.
4. **Phase prediction:** Stronger IMFs mean more energy needed to vaporize. Propanol is a **liquid** at room temperature (boiling point: 97 degrees C).

The single structural difference -- an -OH group replacing one H atom -- transforms the molecule from nonpolar (London only, gas) to polar with hydrogen bonding capability (liquid). The chain is: structure (presence of -OH) determines polarity, polarity determines IMF type (hydrogen bonding), IMF strength determines phase. This is the reasoning engine of the STR domain.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.4, Question 5

**Question**: A water treatment plant needs to remove dissolved lead ions (Pb2+) from drinking water. Why did the lead dissolve in water in the first place?

**Model Answer**:

This is explained by **Water as Solvent (DEF-STR010)**, built on **Molecular Polarity (DEF-STR002)**, **Hydrogen Bond (DEF-STR003)**, and **"Like Dissolves Like" (DEF-STR004)**.

Lead ions (Pb2+) are positively charged particles -- they are cations with a full +2 charge. Water is a highly polar molecule with a bent geometry that creates a strong permanent dipole (delta-minus on the oxygen end, delta-plus on the hydrogen end). When Pb2+ ions encounter water, the polar water molecules orient themselves around each lead ion with their delta-minus oxygen ends pointing toward the positive lead ion. This creates strong **ion-dipole interactions** -- the attraction between a fully charged ion and the partial charge on a polar molecule.

These ion-dipole interactions form a **hydration shell** around each Pb2+ ion, effectively surrounding it with a cage of water molecules. The energy released by forming this hydration shell compensates for the energy needed to pull the lead ions away from whatever solid or compound they were originally part of. The result: the lead ions dissolve and become mobile in the water.

This is precisely why lead contamination in drinking water is such a serious problem. Water is such an effective solvent for ions (due to its strong polarity, hydrogen bonding network, and small molecular size) that it readily dissolves lead from old pipes, solder, and plumbing fixtures. The dissolved Pb2+ ions are invisible -- the water looks perfectly clear -- but the lead is there, in solution, surrounded by hydration shells. Removing these dissolved ions requires specific treatment methods (such as filtration through ion-exchange resins or reverse osmosis) because simple physical filtration cannot capture individual dissolved ions.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.5, Question 1

**Question**: Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) have the same molecular formula (C2H6O). Predict which has a higher boiling point, and explain why.

**Model Answer**:

This is a classic application of **Isomer Recognition (DEF-STR005)** combined with **Structure-to-Property Inference (PRIM-STR005)**.

Both molecules have the molecular formula C2H6O -- same atoms, same count. They are structural isomers: same formula, different connectivity. The question is whether that structural difference affects properties. The answer is yes, dramatically.

**Ethanol (CH3CH2OH):** The oxygen is bonded to both a carbon and a hydrogen, creating an O--H group. This O--H bond is polar (delta-EN = 1.2) and meets the criteria for **Hydrogen Bonding (DEF-STR003)**: hydrogen bonded to oxygen. Ethanol molecules can form hydrogen bonds with each other, creating relatively strong intermolecular attractions.

**Dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3):** The oxygen is bonded to two carbon atoms, with no O--H group. Although the C--O bonds are polar and the molecule has a net dipole (making it a polar molecule with dipole-dipole forces), dimethyl ether cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor because it has no H directly bonded to O, N, or F. Its IMFs are dipole-dipole and London forces, but no hydrogen bonding as a donor.

Hydrogen bonding is significantly stronger than ordinary dipole-dipole forces. Therefore, **ethanol has the higher boiling point**. Ethanol boils at 78 degrees C (liquid at room temperature), while dimethyl ether boils at -24 degrees C (gas at room temperature). Same formula, same atom count, but a 102-degree difference in boiling point -- entirely due to the structural difference that gives ethanol an O--H group capable of hydrogen bonding.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.5, Question 2

**Question**: Why does increasing carbon chain length increase a hydrocarbon's boiling point?

**Model Answer**:

This is explained by **Carbon Backbone Reasoning (DEF-STR007)** and the **Intermolecular Force Hierarchy (PRIM-STR004)**, specifically the size-dependence of London dispersion forces.

Hydrocarbons (molecules containing only carbon and hydrogen) are nonpolar. Their only intermolecular forces are London dispersion forces. However, London forces are not fixed in strength -- they increase with molecular size. Two factors drive this:

**More electrons:** Each additional carbon atom adds 6 electrons and each additional hydrogen adds 1 electron to the molecule. More electrons means more charged particles that can undergo the temporary fluctuations that create London forces. A larger "pool" of electrons produces stronger momentary dipoles.

**More surface area:** Longer carbon chains provide more surface area over which adjacent molecules can make contact. When two long hydrocarbon chains lie alongside each other, there are many points of contact where London forces operate simultaneously. These individual weak interactions add up along the length of the chain, producing a substantial cumulative attraction.

Using **Structure-to-Property Inference (PRIM-STR005)**: stronger London forces mean more energy is needed to pull molecules apart into the gas phase, which means a higher boiling point. This is why methane (1 carbon, boiling point -161 degrees C) is a gas, octane (8 carbons, boiling point 126 degrees C) is a liquid, and eicosane (20 carbons, boiling point 343 degrees C) is a waxy solid. The progression from natural gas to gasoline to candle wax is a direct consequence of increasing chain length and the resulting increase in London forces.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.5, Question 3

**Question**: Two polymer samples are made from the same monomer. Sample A has long, straight chains. Sample B has short, highly branched chains. Which would you predict is stiffer? Why?

**Model Answer**:

This uses **Polymer Reasoning (DEF-STR008)**, which depends on **Carbon Backbone Reasoning (DEF-STR007)** and the **Intermolecular Force Hierarchy (PRIM-STR004)**.

**Sample A (long, straight chains)** would be **stiffer**. Two structural features favor this prediction:

First, **chain length:** Longer chains have more surface area for London dispersion force contacts between neighboring chains. More London force contact points mean stronger total intermolecular attraction between chains, holding them in place more rigidly.

Second, **branching (or lack thereof):** Straight chains can pack closely together, like uncooked spaghetti neatly aligned in a box. Close packing maximizes the surface area in contact between adjacent chains, which maximizes London force interactions. By contrast, branched chains cannot pack closely -- the branches stick out and prevent neighboring chains from lying flat against each other, like a pile of tree branches that cannot be neatly stacked. Less contact area means fewer London force interactions and weaker overall cohesion.

Sample B (short, highly branched chains) has two disadvantages: shorter chains provide less London force contact per chain, and branching prevents close packing. The result is a softer, more flexible, lower-density material. This is exactly the difference between high-density polyethylene (HDPE -- long, straight chains, used in sturdy milk jugs and pipes) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE -- shorter, branched chains, used in flexible plastic bags and cling wrap). Same monomer, different chain architecture, different material properties.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.5, Question 4

**Question**: Kevlar is much stronger than polyethylene, even though both are polymers. What structural difference accounts for this?

**Model Answer**:

This is answered by **Polymer Reasoning (DEF-STR008)**, specifically the role of monomer polarity and intermolecular forces between polymer chains.

The key structural difference is in the **intermolecular forces between chains**. Polyethylene is made from ethylene monomers (CH2=CH2), producing long chains of -CH2-CH2- units. These chains are entirely nonpolar -- all C--H and C--C bonds. The only forces holding neighboring polyethylene chains near each other are **London dispersion forces**, which are individually weak.

Kevlar is a polyaramid -- its monomers contain aromatic rings and amide groups (-CO-NH-). The amide groups are highly polar and contain both C=O and N--H bonds. The N--H group can donate hydrogen bonds (**DEF-STR003** -- H bonded to N), and the C=O group can accept them (lone pairs on oxygen). This means Kevlar chains are held together by extensive **hydrogen bonding** between chains, in addition to London forces.

According to the **Intermolecular Force Hierarchy (PRIM-STR004)**, hydrogen bonds are roughly 10 times stronger than typical London forces. Kevlar's dense network of interchain hydrogen bonds creates a material that is extraordinarily resistant to stretching and tearing. Each chain is tightly locked to its neighbors by these strong interactions. Polyethylene's chains, held together only by weak London forces, slide past each other relatively easily.

This is why Kevlar can stop a bullet while a polyethylene bag cannot. The structural difference -- polar amide groups enabling hydrogen bonding versus nonpolar CH2 units limited to London forces -- translates directly to a macroscopic property difference via the IMF hierarchy. Same concept (polymer), different monomer chemistry, dramatically different material strength.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.5, Question 5

**Question**: A company advertises a "biodegradable plastic bag." Using polymer reasoning, what structural feature would make a polymer biodegradable?

**Model Answer**:

Using **Polymer Reasoning (DEF-STR008)** and **Carbon Backbone Reasoning (DEF-STR007)**:

A biodegradable polymer would need to have **polar, hydrolyzable bonds in its backbone** -- bonds that microorganisms' enzymes can recognize and break. The key structural feature is the presence of functional groups like ester linkages (-COO-), amide linkages (-CONH-), or other polar bonds within the chain backbone that are susceptible to hydrolysis (breaking by reaction with water).

Standard polyethylene has a backbone made entirely of C--C bonds. These bonds are nonpolar, very stable, and not recognized by most biological enzymes. Microorganisms simply lack the chemical tools to efficiently cut a pure hydrocarbon chain. This is why polyethylene plastic bags persist in the environment for hundreds of years.

By contrast, biodegradable polymers like polylactic acid (PLA, made from plant sugars) have ester linkages (-COO-) in their backbone. These polar bonds are susceptible to hydrolysis: water molecules, aided by microbial enzymes, can break the ester bond and cleave the chain into smaller fragments. Once broken into small enough pieces, the fragments can be metabolized by microorganisms.

The **Structure-to-Property Inference (PRIM-STR005)** is clear: the presence of polar, enzyme-accessible bonds in the polymer backbone determines whether the material can be biologically decomposed. Biodegradability is not about the monomer being "natural" or "green" -- it is about whether the backbone bonds are the kind that biological enzymes can cut. Designing biodegradable plastics is fundamentally a question of choosing monomers that produce breakable backbone linkages.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.E, Question 1

**Question**: Using the electron sea model, explain why metals conduct electricity but ionic solids (in solid form) do not.

**Model Answer**:

This is explained by **Metallic Structure (DEF-STR009)**, which uses the electron sea model.

In a metal like copper, the valence electrons are **delocalized** -- they are not bound to any particular atom but instead flow freely throughout the entire metallic lattice. When a voltage is applied (say, by connecting a copper wire to a battery), these free electrons respond by flowing through the metal from the negative terminal toward the positive terminal. This flow of electrons is electrical current. The electron sea provides a highway for charge transport.

In an ionic solid like NaCl, there are no delocalized electrons. The Na+ cations and Cl- anions are locked in a rigid crystal lattice. Each ion is held in place by strong electrostatic attractions to its oppositely charged neighbors. Although ionic compounds contain charged particles (ions) that could in principle carry current, those ions cannot move in the solid state -- they are trapped in fixed positions. No movement of charge means no electrical conductivity.

The contrast is structural: metals have a mobile charge carrier (delocalized electrons) present in the solid state, while ionic solids have fixed charge carriers (locked ions) that cannot move. This is why copper wiring conducts electricity and salt crystals do not. However, when an ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water, the ions become free to move -- and the substance becomes conductive. Molten NaCl and dissolved NaCl both conduct electricity because the ions are now mobile. The electron sea model explains why metals are unique in conducting electricity as solids.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.E, Question 2

**Question**: Why does a metal bend when struck with a hammer, while a salt crystal shatters?

**Model Answer**:

This difference is explained by **Metallic Structure (DEF-STR009)** and the contrast between metallic and ionic bonding.

**Metals bend (malleability):** In a metal, cation layers are surrounded by a delocalized electron sea. When a hammer strikes the metal and displaces one layer of cations relative to another, the bonding is not disrupted. The electron sea simply flows and redistributes to accommodate the new arrangement. No cation ever finds itself next to a "wrong" neighbor -- the electrons are everywhere, maintaining the attractive force regardless of which cations are adjacent. The metal deforms but does not break.

**Ionic solids shatter (brittleness):** In an ionic crystal like NaCl, the structure consists of alternating Na+ and Cl- ions in a rigid lattice. Every Na+ is surrounded by Cl- ions, and every Cl- is surrounded by Na+ ions. When a hammer strikes and displaces one layer, the previously favorable arrangement is disrupted: Na+ ions may end up adjacent to other Na+ ions, and Cl- ions may end up next to other Cl- ions. Like charges repel, and the repulsion shatters the crystal along the plane of displacement. Unlike the electron sea, ionic bonding is directional and position-specific -- displacement brings like charges together, which is catastrophic for the structure.

The key structural difference is the nature of the bonding: metallic bonding is non-directional (the electron sea accommodates any arrangement of cations), while ionic bonding is position-specific (ions must alternate in charge). This is why metals are used for structural applications that require bending and shaping (car bodies, bridges, wires), while ionic solids are not.

### Chapter 2 (STR): Section 2.E, Question 3

**Question**: Mercury is a liquid metal at room temperature. Does the electron sea model still apply to mercury? What might explain its low melting point?

**Model Answer**:

Yes, the electron sea model still applies to mercury. **Metallic Structure (DEF-STR009)** describes a general model for metallic bonding -- it applies to all metals, whether solid or liquid. Mercury (Hg) has a lattice of Hg cations surrounded by delocalized valence electrons, just like any other metal. This is confirmed by mercury's metallic properties: it conducts electricity, has a metallic luster (it is shiny and reflective), and conducts heat efficiently. These properties are hallmarks of the electron sea model.

What explains its low melting point (-39 degrees C, making it a liquid at room temperature)? The melting point of a metal depends on the strength of the metallic bond, which in turn depends on how strongly the delocalized electrons hold the cation lattice together. Several factors weaken mercury's metallic bonding:

Mercury is in period 6 and has a filled 4f subshell. The electrons in this inner subshell provide poor shielding of the nuclear charge, which causes the outermost electrons to be pulled in closer to the nucleus (a phenomenon called the "lanthanide contraction" and relativistic effects). The result is that mercury's valence electrons are held more tightly by individual atoms and are less effectively shared across the lattice. The electron sea is "thinner" and less cohesive than in metals like iron or tungsten, where valence electrons are more freely delocalized.

Additionally, mercury contributes relatively few electrons to the sea and has a relatively large ionic radius, both of which reduce the density of attractive interactions in the lattice. The cumulative result is a metallic bond too weak to maintain a solid structure at room temperature, making mercury the only metal that is liquid under standard conditions. The electron sea model still applies -- it just predicts a weaker interaction in this case.
