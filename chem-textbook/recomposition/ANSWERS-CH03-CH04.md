### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.1, Question 1

**Question**: A flashlight converts chemical energy (battery) into light and heat. Does this violate energy conservation? Where does the energy go when the flashlight dims and eventually dies?

**Model Answer**:

No, this does not violate energy conservation. Using **energy tracking** (**PRIM-NRG001**), we can trace every joule of energy through the system. The chemical energy stored in the battery's molecular bonds is converted into two output forms: radiant energy (the visible light from the bulb) and thermal energy (heat -- the flashlight feels warm during use). At every instant, the total energy coming out of the battery equals the total light energy plus the total thermal energy produced. The ledger balances perfectly.

When the flashlight dims and eventually dies, the chemical energy stored in the battery has been fully converted. The battery's reactants have been transformed into products with lower chemical energy, and the difference has already left the system as light and heat. The light energy was absorbed by whatever surfaces it struck -- walls, floors, objects -- and ultimately converted to thermal energy, slightly warming the surroundings. The heat energy dissipated into the environment. No energy was destroyed; it simply changed form from concentrated chemical energy into diffuse thermal energy spread throughout the room. This is why you cannot "recharge" a disposable battery by shining the flashlight's light back at it -- the energy has been irreversibly dispersed, not lost.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.1, Question 2

**Question**: A swimming pool at 25 degrees C and a cup of tea at 70 degrees C are sitting side by side. Which contains more total thermal energy? Which is at a higher temperature? Explain the difference.

**Model Answer**:

The cup of tea is at a higher temperature (70 degrees C versus 25 degrees C), but the swimming pool contains far more total thermal energy. This question requires the **heat vs. temperature** distinction (**DEF-NRG001**).

Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. The tea molecules are moving faster on average than the pool water molecules, so the tea has a higher temperature. However, thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of all the molecules combined, not just the average. The swimming pool contains an enormously greater number of water molecules -- perhaps tens of thousands of liters compared to one cup (about 0.25 liters). Even though each pool molecule has less kinetic energy on average than each tea molecule, the sheer number of molecules in the pool means the pool's total thermal energy dwarfs the tea's.

A practical consequence: if you needed to warm a cold room, the swimming pool of lukewarm water would be far more effective than the cup of hot tea. The pool has much more total thermal energy available to transfer. The tea is hotter (higher temperature, higher average molecular kinetic energy) but holds less total energy because it contains far fewer molecules. This distinction -- temperature as an intensive property (independent of amount) versus thermal energy as an extensive property (dependent on amount) -- is one of the most important conceptual separations in energy reasoning.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.1, Question 3

**Question**: A nutrition label lists 30 g of carbohydrate, 10 g of fat, and 8 g of protein. Estimate the total Calories and convert to kilojoules.

**Model Answer**:

This problem uses **energy tracking** (**PRIM-NRG001**) applied to food and the **calorie/joule** conversion (**DEF-NRG005**). We apply the standard energy yields per gram of each macronutrient: carbohydrates provide approximately 4 Cal/g, fats provide approximately 9 Cal/g, and proteins provide approximately 4 Cal/g.

Step-by-step calculation:
- Carbohydrate: 30 g x 4 Cal/g = 120 Cal
- Fat: 10 g x 9 Cal/g = 90 Cal
- Protein: 8 g x 4 Cal/g = 32 Cal
- Total: 120 + 90 + 32 = **242 Cal** (approximately 240 Cal)

To convert to kilojoules, we use the conversion factor: 1 food Calorie (Cal) = 4.184 kJ.

242 Cal x 4.184 kJ/Cal = **1,013 kJ** (approximately 1,010 kJ)

Notice that fat contributes 90 Cal out of the total 242 Cal -- about 37% of the energy from only 10 g out of 48 g total (about 21% of the mass). This illustrates why fat is described as "calorie-dense": it stores more than twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrates or protein because of the higher energy content of its molecular bonds. This calculation is exactly how nutrition labels are generated -- by measuring the grams of each macronutrient and multiplying by the known energy yield per gram.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.1, Question 4

**Question**: Your body temperature is 37 degrees C. You hold an ice cube (0 degrees C) in your hand. Describe the direction of heat flow and what happens to the ice cube. Use the terms "heat," "temperature," and "thermal equilibrium" correctly.

**Model Answer**:

This question requires applying the **heat vs. temperature** distinction (**DEF-NRG001**) and **energy tracking** (**PRIM-NRG001**). Your hand is at a higher temperature (37 degrees C) than the ice cube (0 degrees C). Because heat always flows from the hotter object to the cooler object, thermal energy transfers from your hand into the ice cube. This transfer of energy is heat -- it is not a substance moving from hand to ice but rather a process of energy flowing due to the temperature difference.

As your hand loses thermal energy, the molecules in your skin slow down slightly, and you perceive a sensation of cold. The ice cube gains thermal energy, and that energy goes toward overcoming the hydrogen bonds holding the water molecules in the rigid crystal lattice. The ice begins to melt -- the absorbed heat breaks the orderly arrangement of the solid and allows molecules to move more freely as liquid water. During the melting process, the ice stays at 0 degrees C even as it absorbs heat (the energy goes into breaking intermolecular bonds, not into increasing molecular speed).

If you held the ice long enough, all of it would melt and the resulting water would continue to warm. Eventually, the water and your hand would approach the same temperature -- a state called thermal equilibrium, where heat flow ceases because there is no longer a temperature difference to drive it. In practice, you drop the ice long before equilibrium is reached, but the principle holds: heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold until temperatures equalize.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.1, Question 5

**Question**: Convert 500 food Calories to (a) kilocalories, (b) calories, and (c) kilojoules.

**Model Answer**:

This is a direct application of the **calorie/joule** unit conversion (**DEF-NRG005**). The key facts are: 1 food Calorie (Cal, capital C) = 1 kilocalorie (kcal) = 1,000 calories (cal) = 4.184 kilojoules (kJ).

(a) **Kilocalories**: Since 1 food Calorie is defined as exactly 1 kilocalorie, the conversion is direct.
500 Cal = **500 kcal**

(b) **Calories** (lowercase): Since 1 kilocalorie = 1,000 calories:
500 kcal x 1,000 cal/kcal = **500,000 cal** (or 5.00 x 10^5 cal)

(c) **Kilojoules**: Since 1 food Calorie = 4.184 kJ:
500 Cal x 4.184 kJ/Cal = **2,092 kJ** (approximately 2,090 kJ)

The source of endless confusion is the food industry's use of "Calorie" (capital C) to mean kilocalorie. When a candy bar says "250 Calories," it actually contains 250,000 calories (lowercase) of energy -- a factor of 1,000 difference hidden behind a single capitalized letter. For scientific work, joules and kilojoules are the standard SI units, which is why the conversion to kJ is particularly important. The 500 Cal in this problem -- roughly the energy content of a large meal -- represents about 2,090 kJ of chemical energy stored in molecular bonds, available to be converted into body heat and mechanical work through metabolic processes.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.2, Question 1

**Question**: A student says, "When you burn wood, the bonds in wood break apart and release energy." What is wrong with this statement? Correct it using bond energy reasoning (PRIM-NRG002).

**Model Answer**:

This statement contains one of the most persistent misconceptions in introductory chemistry. Using **bond energy reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG002**), the correct principle is: **breaking bonds ALWAYS requires energy; forming bonds ALWAYS releases energy.** The student has the direction of energy flow backward for the bond-breaking step.

When wood burns, two things happen in sequence. First, bonds in the wood's cellulose molecules (C-H, C-O, C-C bonds) and in oxygen gas (O=O bonds) must be broken. This step costs energy -- it is an energy investment. Second, new bonds form in the products: C=O bonds in carbon dioxide (CO2) and O-H bonds in water (H2O). This step releases energy -- it is the energy payoff.

The reason burning wood releases energy overall is not because bonds break, but because the bonds that form in the products (C=O and O-H) are collectively stronger than the bonds that were broken in the reactants (C-H, C-O, C-C, and O=O). More energy is released during bond formation than was invested during bond breaking. The surplus energy is what you feel as heat and see as light from the fire. The corrected statement should read: "When you burn wood, breaking the bonds in wood and oxygen requires energy, but forming the stronger bonds in carbon dioxide and water releases more energy than was invested. The net surplus is the heat and light of the fire." This corrected reasoning, grounded in **PRIM-NRG002**, gives you a reliable tool for predicting energy flow in any reaction.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.2, Question 2

**Question**: An instant cold pack feels cold when activated. Is the dissolution of ammonium nitrate exothermic or endothermic? What is the sign of delta-H?

**Model Answer**:

Using **exo/endothermic classification** (**PRIM-NRG003**) and the **enthalpy change** framework (**DEF-NRG003**), we can determine the classification from the observable evidence. When the cold pack is activated, ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) dissolves in water, and the pack gets cold against your skin. The fact that the surroundings (your hand, the pack's outer surface) get cooler means that energy is being absorbed from the surroundings into the dissolving process. The process is pulling thermal energy away from your hand.

This is the defining characteristic of an **endothermic** process: the system absorbs energy from the surroundings, causing the surroundings to cool. The sign of delta-H is **positive** (delta-H > 0). Specifically, for the dissolution of ammonium nitrate, delta-H is approximately +25.7 kJ/mol.

At the molecular level, **bond energy reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG002**) explains why. Breaking apart the ionic lattice of solid NH4NO3 (separating the NH4+ and NO3- ions from each other) requires energy. When the ions are hydrated (surrounded by water molecules), new ion-water interactions form and release energy. For ammonium nitrate, the energy required to break the lattice is greater than the energy released by hydration. The net result is a deficit -- the process must absorb the missing energy from the surroundings, which is why your hand feels cold. This is why cold packs work: they harness an endothermic dissolution to absorb heat from an injured area.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.2, Question 3

**Question**: Combustion of hydrogen gas: 2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(l), delta-H = -572 kJ. Is this reaction exothermic or endothermic? What does the negative sign tell you about the relative strength of the bonds formed versus the bonds broken?

**Model Answer**:

Using **exo/endothermic classification** (**PRIM-NRG003**) and the **enthalpy change** sign convention (**DEF-NRG003**), a negative delta-H means the reaction releases energy to the surroundings. This reaction is **exothermic**. The 572 kJ of energy released per two moles of water produced exits the system as heat, warming the surroundings. This is why hydrogen combustion produces a very hot flame and why hydrogen is being explored as a clean fuel (the only product is water).

The negative sign tells us something specific about bond strengths through **bond energy reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG002**). In this reaction, the bonds broken are H-H bonds (in H2) and an O=O bond (in O2). The bonds formed are O-H bonds (in H2O). Since delta-H is negative, more energy was released in forming the O-H bonds in the products than was required to break the H-H and O=O bonds in the reactants. In other words, the O-H bonds in water are collectively stronger than the H-H and O=O bonds that were broken. The products sit at a lower energy level than the reactants -- the surplus energy (572 kJ per mole of reaction as written) is what heats the surroundings.

This is a strongly exothermic reaction, comparable in magnitude to the combustion of methane (-890 kJ/mol). The large negative delta-H reflects the exceptional strength of the O-H bonds in water, which makes hydrogen combustion an energetically favorable process and explains the interest in hydrogen as a fuel source for a carbon-free energy economy.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.2, Question 4

**Question**: Photosynthesis and combustion of glucose are reverse reactions. If photosynthesis has delta-H = +2,803 kJ/mol, what is delta-H for the combustion of glucose? Explain your reasoning.

**Model Answer**:

The delta-H for the combustion of glucose is **-2,803 kJ/mol**. This follows directly from the fact that enthalpy is a **state function** (**DEF-NRG003**), meaning delta-H depends only on the starting and ending states, not on the path taken.

Photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen:
6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2, delta-H = +2,803 kJ/mol

Combustion of glucose is the exact reverse:
C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O, delta-H = ?

When a reaction is reversed, the starting and ending states swap. Using **energy tracking** (**PRIM-NRG001**), if the forward reaction (photosynthesis) absorbs 2,803 kJ of energy, then the reverse reaction (combustion) must release exactly 2,803 kJ. The magnitude is the same; the sign flips. The energy that sunlight pumped into the glucose molecule during photosynthesis is released when that glucose is burned. Photosynthesis is endothermic (delta-H positive, energy absorbed from sunlight), and combustion is exothermic (delta-H negative, energy released as heat).

This relationship has profound real-world significance. The energy in every piece of food you eat was originally captured from sunlight by photosynthesis. When your body metabolizes glucose (a controlled form of combustion), it releases that stored solar energy to power your muscles, maintain body temperature, and drive cellular processes. The energy books balance: the sun provides +2,803 kJ to build each mole of glucose; your body recovers -2,803 kJ when it breaks that glucose back down. Energy is conserved across the entire cycle.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.2, Question 5

**Question**: Draw a simple energy diagram (like the ones shown above) for a reaction with delta-H = -200 kJ. Label the reactants, products, and the energy released.

**Model Answer**:

Using **exo/endothermic classification** (**PRIM-NRG003**) and **enthalpy change** (**DEF-NRG003**), a reaction with delta-H = -200 kJ is exothermic -- the products are at a lower energy level than the reactants, and 200 kJ of energy is released to the surroundings.

The energy diagram should look like this:

```
Energy
  |
  |  Reactants
  |  ---------
  |        \
  |         \
  |          \   } delta-H = -200 kJ (energy released)
  |           \
  |            \
  |   Products  \
  |   ----------
  |
  +------------------
     Reaction progress
```

Key features to label: (1) The reactants energy level is at the top, drawn as a horizontal line on the left side. (2) The products energy level is lower, drawn as a horizontal line on the right side. (3) The vertical distance between the reactant line and the product line represents the magnitude of delta-H, which is 200 kJ. An arrow pointing downward between the two levels, labeled "delta-H = -200 kJ" or "200 kJ released," indicates that the products have 200 kJ less energy than the reactants. This 200 kJ has been transferred to the surroundings as heat, consistent with **energy tracking** (**PRIM-NRG001**) -- the energy did not disappear; it was released from the chemical system into the environment.

Note that this diagram does not show activation energy (the hill that must be climbed to get the reaction started). That would require adding a peak between the reactant and product levels, which is covered in NRG.4. Here, we are only showing the net energy change.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.3, Question 1

**Question**: A drop of perfume is released at one end of a room. Eventually, you can smell it at the other end. Is this process driven by energy, entropy, or both? Explain using the concept of arrangements.

**Model Answer**:

This process is driven primarily by **entropy**, not energy. Using **entropy reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG004**), we analyze the number of possible molecular arrangements before and after the perfume spreads.

Initially, all the perfume molecules are concentrated in a tiny region at one end of the room. The number of ways to arrange those molecules is relatively small -- they are confined to a very limited volume. After the perfume diffuses throughout the room, the same molecules can occupy any position in the entire room. The number of possible arrangements is astronomically larger: each molecule now has the freedom to be anywhere in the room's volume rather than in one small spot. Since a state with more possible arrangements is overwhelmingly more probable, the perfume spreads spontaneously toward the dispersed state. This is exactly like shuffling a sorted deck of cards -- the number of "spread out" arrangements vastly outnumbers the "concentrated" arrangements, so the spread-out state is overwhelmingly favored by probability.

Importantly, no significant energy is released or absorbed during this process. The room does not get warmer or cooler when perfume diffuses through air. This is not an exothermic or endothermic process in any meaningful sense -- it is approximately thermoneutral. The process is driven almost entirely by the entropy increase. Using **spontaneity reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG005**), this demonstrates that energy favorability is not the only driver of change. Entropy alone can make a process spontaneous, which is why the perfume spreads even though no energy is released. The dispersed state is simply overwhelmingly more probable than the concentrated state.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.3, Question 2

**Question**: Freezing water is exothermic. Does that mean it is always spontaneous? Why or why not? Use the four-case matrix.

**Model Answer**:

No, the fact that freezing water is exothermic does not mean it is always spontaneous. This requires **spontaneity reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG005**) and the four-case matrix.

When water freezes, two things happen simultaneously. First, the energy change: freezing is exothermic (delta-H < 0), meaning liquid water releases thermal energy to the surroundings as it solidifies. This is energetically favorable. Second, the entropy change: using **entropy reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG004**), liquid water molecules have many possible arrangements (they can slide, rotate, and move freely). In ice, molecules are locked into a rigid crystal lattice with very few possible arrangements. Freezing decreases entropy (delta-S < 0). This is entropically unfavorable.

This is **Case 3** from the spontaneity matrix: exothermic (energy favorable) + entropy decrease (entropy unfavorable). Case 3 processes are **spontaneous only at low temperature**. At low temperatures, the energy drive dominates and the entropy penalty is small -- freezing is spontaneous below 0 degrees C. At high temperatures, the entropy term becomes more important and outweighs the energy favorability -- freezing is non-spontaneous above 0 degrees C. At exactly 0 degrees C, the two drives are perfectly balanced, and ice and liquid water coexist in equilibrium.

This is a powerful illustration of why energy alone does not determine spontaneity. Freezing is always exothermic, at any temperature. But it is only spontaneous when the temperature is low enough for the energy drive to overpower the entropy penalty. Temperature is the referee between the two competing drivers of change.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.3, Question 3

**Question**: A student says, "Entropy means disorder, so a messy room has higher entropy than a clean room." Explain why this statement is incorrect.

**Model Answer**:

This statement reflects a common and actively misleading misconception about entropy. Using the correct definition from **entropy reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG004**), entropy is not about visual disorder or spatial messiness. Entropy is a measure of how many different ways the particles and energy in a system can be arranged at the molecular level -- the number of microstates.

A messy room and a clean room have essentially the same entropy from a thermodynamic perspective. The books on the floor, the clothes on the chair, and the scattered papers are macroscopic objects. Moving a book from a shelf to the floor does not change the number of molecular arrangements of the atoms in that book -- the atoms in the book's pages, binding, and ink have the same thermal motion, the same distribution of kinetic energies, and the same number of microstates regardless of whether the book is shelved or on the floor. Entropy in physics and chemistry refers to the statistical distribution of atoms, molecules, and energy at the submicroscopic level, not to the spatial arrangement of macroscopic objects.

The "disorder" metaphor fails because it encourages students to apply entropy to any situation that looks disorganized, rather than to the actual quantity it measures: the number of ways molecules and energy can be arranged. A better mental model is the deck-of-cards analogy: there are astronomically more shuffled arrangements than sorted ones, so shuffling is overwhelmingly probable. This probability-based understanding -- more arrangements equals higher entropy equals more probable -- is accurate, transferable, and avoids the misleading "messy room" trap entirely.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.3, Question 4

**Question**: Classify each of the following as Case 1, 2, 3, or 4 from the spontaneity matrix: (a) burning propane at any temperature, (b) water evaporating on a hot summer day, (c) a gas condensing to a liquid in a freezer.

**Model Answer**:

Each classification requires **exo/endothermic classification** (**PRIM-NRG003**), **entropy reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG004**), and the **spontaneity reasoning** matrix (**PRIM-NRG005**).

**(a) Burning propane at any temperature: Case 1 (always spontaneous).**
Combustion of propane is exothermic (delta-H = -2,220 kJ/mol; energy is released as heat and light). The products are CO2 gas and H2O gas -- more total molecules of gas than the reactants (C3H8 + 5O2 produces 3CO2 + 4H2O, going from 6 molecules of gas to 7). Entropy increases because there are more gas molecules and more possible arrangements. Exothermic + entropy increase = Case 1, spontaneous at all temperatures. (Note: propane still needs a spark to get started because of activation energy, but the spontaneity classification tells us it is thermodynamically favorable at any temperature.)

**(b) Water evaporating on a hot summer day: Case 4 (spontaneous at high temperature).**
Evaporation is endothermic -- liquid water must absorb thermal energy from the surroundings to transition to gas (you feel cooling when water evaporates from your skin). Entropy increases enormously -- gas molecules have vastly more possible positions, orientations, and energy distributions than liquid molecules. Endothermic + entropy increase = Case 4, spontaneous at high temperature. A hot summer day provides the high temperature needed for the entropy drive to outweigh the energy penalty.

**(c) A gas condensing to a liquid in a freezer: Case 3 (spontaneous at low temperature).**
Condensation is exothermic -- gas molecules release energy as they form intermolecular bonds in the liquid state. Entropy decreases -- liquid molecules have far fewer possible arrangements than gas molecules. Exothermic + entropy decrease = Case 3, spontaneous at low temperature. The freezer provides the low temperature needed for the energy drive to outweigh the entropy penalty.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.3, Question 5

**Question**: Diamond converting to graphite is spontaneous at room temperature and pressure, but it does not visibly happen. Does this contradict the definition of "spontaneous"? Explain.

**Model Answer**:

No, this does not contradict the definition of spontaneous. This apparent paradox is resolved by distinguishing between spontaneity (a thermodynamic concept) and rate (a kinetic concept), using **spontaneity reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG005**) and **activation energy reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG006**).

Spontaneous means thermodynamically favorable -- the process has a net favorable combination of energy and entropy drives. It does NOT mean fast. The definition of spontaneous is that the process will occur without continuous external energy input, given enough time. Diamond converting to graphite is spontaneous because graphite is the more thermodynamically stable form of carbon at room temperature and pressure. The free energy of graphite is lower than that of diamond under these conditions.

However, the conversion does not visibly happen because the **activation energy barrier** (**PRIM-NRG006**) is extraordinarily high. To rearrange carbon atoms from the diamond crystal structure (each carbon bonded to four others in a rigid 3D network) to the graphite structure (layers of carbon atoms in flat hexagonal sheets) requires breaking and reforming an enormous number of very strong C-C bonds simultaneously. The energy barrier for this rearrangement is so high that, at room temperature, essentially no carbon atoms have enough kinetic energy to overcome it. The rate of conversion is so slow that it would take billions of years to observe any measurable change.

This is the key lesson: spontaneity tells you IF a process is favorable (the destination). Activation energy tells you HOW HARD it is to get started (the barrier). Both questions must be answered to predict what actually happens. Your diamond ring is thermodynamically unstable but kinetically trapped -- and will remain so for longer than the age of the universe.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.4, Question 1

**Question**: Hydrogen gas and oxygen gas can sit in the same container without reacting. Yet the reaction 2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(l) has delta-H = -572 kJ. Why does the reaction not occur? What would make it happen?

**Model Answer**:

This is a classic application of **activation energy reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG006**). The reaction is strongly exothermic (delta-H = -572 kJ), and using **spontaneity reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG005**), we can further note that combustion of hydrogen produces liquid water from gases, but the large energy release makes this Case 1 (or close to it) on the spontaneity matrix -- thermodynamically favorable. Yet the hydrogen and oxygen sit unreacted in the same container at room temperature.

The reason is that the activation energy barrier is too high. For H2 and O2 molecules to react, they must first collide with enough kinetic energy to begin breaking their existing bonds (H-H and O=O) and start forming new O-H bonds. At room temperature, the vast majority of molecules do not have enough kinetic energy to reach the transition state -- the high-energy intermediate configuration at the top of the activation energy hill. The reaction is thermodynamically favorable but kinetically blocked.

Three approaches would make the reaction happen. First, you could **provide a spark or flame** -- a localized burst of energy that gives a small number of molecules enough kinetic energy to overcome the barrier. Once those molecules react, the 572 kJ they release pushes neighboring molecules over the barrier, and the reaction propagates rapidly (this is why hydrogen-oxygen mixtures are explosive when ignited). Second, you could **raise the temperature** -- at higher temperatures, more molecules have sufficient kinetic energy to clear the Ea hill. Third, you could **add a catalyst** (such as platinum metal), which provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. The catalyst does not change delta-H (-572 kJ remains the same); it simply lowers the hill, allowing the reaction to proceed at a lower temperature.

---

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.4, Question 2

**Question**: A catalyst lowers the activation energy of a reaction. Does it change the delta-H of the reaction? Does it change whether the reaction is spontaneous? What does it change?

**Model Answer**:

A catalyst does **not** change delta-H, and it does **not** change whether the reaction is spontaneous. Using **activation energy reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG006**) and **enthalpy change** (**DEF-NRG003**), we can carefully distinguish what a catalyst affects from what it leaves unchanged.

Delta-H is determined solely by the difference in energy between reactants and products. It is a **state function** -- it depends only on the starting and ending states, not on the path taken between them. A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway (a different route over the hill), but the starting point (reactants) and ending point (products) are exactly the same. Therefore, delta-H is unchanged. Whether the reaction is spontaneous depends on delta-H and entropy change (via **spontaneity reasoning**, **PRIM-NRG005**), and since neither of these changes when a catalyst is present, spontaneity is also unchanged.

What a catalyst does change is the **rate** of the reaction. By lowering the activation energy (Ea), the catalyst allows a larger fraction of molecules to have enough kinetic energy to reach the transition state at any given temperature. More molecules clearing the barrier per unit time means the reaction proceeds faster. Think of it as lowering the hill between two valleys: the destination (products at lower energy) does not change, but more travelers can make the crossing. Additionally, a catalyst is not consumed in the reaction -- it participates in the process but emerges unchanged, ready to facilitate the reaction again. A catalyst turns a reaction that is thermodynamically favorable but kinetically slow into one that is both favorable and fast.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.4, Question 3

**Question**: Equal masses of water and iron are placed in the same oven at 200 degrees C for the same time. Which reaches a higher temperature first? Use specific heat capacity reasoning.

**Model Answer**:

Iron reaches a higher temperature first. This is a direct application of **specific heat capacity** reasoning (**DEF-NRG002**). Specific heat capacity (c) measures how much energy is needed to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius. Water has a specific heat capacity of 4.18 J/g-degrees C, while iron has a specific heat capacity of 0.449 J/g-degrees C.

Because the two samples have equal mass and are in the same oven receiving thermal energy at approximately the same rate, the substance with the lower specific heat capacity will experience a larger temperature change for the same amount of heat absorbed. Iron's specific heat capacity is roughly one-ninth that of water's (0.449 versus 4.18 J/g-degrees C). This means that for every joule of heat absorbed, iron's temperature rises about 9.3 times more than water's temperature. Iron heats up quickly -- it needs relatively little energy per degree of temperature change. Water heats up slowly -- it absorbs a lot of energy before its temperature rises noticeably.

This is the same principle that explains the beach experience described in the chapter. Sand (with a low specific heat capacity similar to iron) gets scorching hot under the midday sun, while the ocean (with water's high specific heat capacity) stays relatively cool. In the kitchen, this is why a metal baking sheet is too hot to touch long before the water in a pot next to it reaches boiling temperature. The oven delivers the same energy to both, but the metal's low specific heat capacity means it reaches high temperatures much sooner.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.4, Question 4

**Question**: Explain why coastal cities generally have milder climates than inland cities at the same latitude, using the concept of specific heat capacity.

**Model Answer**:

Coastal cities have milder climates because of water's exceptionally high **specific heat capacity** (**DEF-NRG002**). Water's specific heat capacity is 4.18 J/g-degrees C -- far higher than almost any other common substance, and roughly 14 times higher than sand (0.290 J/g-degrees C) or typical rock and soil. This means the ocean absorbs and releases enormous amounts of thermal energy with only small changes in temperature. The ocean acts as a massive thermal buffer for nearby land.

In summer, both the ocean and inland land receive the same solar energy per unit area. The land (with its low specific heat capacity) heats up quickly and dramatically -- inland cities get hot. The ocean (with its high specific heat capacity) absorbs the same energy but its temperature rises only slightly. Coastal cities, cooled by ocean breezes, stay relatively mild. In winter, the process reverses. The land loses heat quickly and cools dramatically -- inland cities get cold. The ocean releases its stored thermal energy slowly, keeping its temperature relatively stable. Coastal cities, warmed by the heat the ocean releases, stay relatively mild.

Using **energy tracking** (**PRIM-NRG001**), the total energy entering and leaving both systems is comparable. The difference is in how that energy affects temperature, which is entirely governed by specific heat capacity. The ocean is like a giant thermal savings account -- it accumulates energy slowly in summer (small temperature rise) and releases it slowly in winter (small temperature drop). This is why San Francisco (coastal) has a temperature range of roughly 10-20 degrees C year-round, while Sacramento (90 miles inland) swings from near-freezing winters to 40 degrees C summers. Same latitude, same solar input, vastly different specific heat capacities of the surrounding environment.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.4, Question 5

**Question**: A student says, "If a reaction is spontaneous, it will happen immediately." Is this correct? Use the concepts of spontaneity and activation energy to explain.

**Model Answer**:

This statement is incorrect. It confuses two distinct concepts: **spontaneity** (**PRIM-NRG005**), which tells you whether a process is thermodynamically favorable, and **activation energy** (**PRIM-NRG006**), which determines whether the process can actually get started and how fast it proceeds.

Spontaneous means that the combined effect of energy and entropy drives makes the process favorable -- it will occur without continuous external energy input, given sufficient time. Spontaneous does NOT mean fast, immediate, or even observable on a human timescale. It is a thermodynamic statement about favorability, not a kinetic statement about speed. Consider several examples: diamond converting to graphite at room temperature is spontaneous, but the rate is so slow that no measurable change occurs over billions of years. Iron rusting in moist air is spontaneous, but it takes weeks to months to become visible. Paper combustion in air is spontaneous, but paper sits on your desk indefinitely until a flame provides the activation energy to start the reaction.

The missing piece is activation energy. Even when a reaction is spontaneous (the products are at lower overall free energy than the reactants), there is typically an energy barrier -- the activation energy hill -- that the reactants must climb before they can proceed to products. If the activation energy is high relative to the kinetic energy of the molecules at the current temperature, the reaction will be extremely slow despite being thermodynamically favorable. To predict what actually happens, you need both assessments: spontaneity tells you the direction (will the reaction proceed forward?), and activation energy tells you the rate (how fast, and does it need a push to start?). A complete prediction requires answering both questions.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.E, Question 1

**Question**: A reaction is endothermic and increases entropy. Using the free energy scorecard, at what kind of temperature (high or low) would this reaction be spontaneous? Which case from the four-case matrix is this?

**Model Answer**:

Using the **free energy scorecard** (**DEF-NRG004**) and **spontaneity reasoning** (**PRIM-NRG005**), we evaluate both rows of the scorecard for this reaction.

The energy drive row: The reaction is endothermic (delta-H > 0), which is energetically unfavorable. This row contributes a positive (unfavorable) score to the free energy.

The entropy drive row: The reaction increases entropy (delta-S > 0), which is entropically favorable. This row contributes a negative (favorable) score to the free energy -- but the magnitude of this contribution is weighted by temperature.

At low temperatures, the entropy row barely matters because temperature acts as a weighting factor for the entropy contribution. The unfavorable energy row dominates, and the net score is positive (non-spontaneous). At high temperatures, the entropy row is heavily weighted and can override the unfavorable energy row. The net score becomes negative (spontaneous).

This is **Case 4** from the four-case matrix: endothermic + entropy increase = spontaneous at high temperature. A classic example is ice melting. Melting is endothermic (ice absorbs heat from surroundings) and entropy-increasing (liquid water has vastly more molecular arrangements than solid ice). Below 0 degrees C, the energy penalty dominates and melting is non-spontaneous. Above 0 degrees C, temperature has amplified the entropy drive enough to overcome the energy penalty, and melting becomes spontaneous. At exactly 0 degrees C, the scorecard is perfectly balanced -- ice and liquid water coexist in equilibrium.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.E, Question 2

**Question**: Explain why water freezes at 0 degrees C and melts at 0 degrees C using the free energy scorecard concept. What is special about exactly 0 degrees C?

**Model Answer**:

This question reveals the elegance of the **free energy scorecard** (**DEF-NRG004**) when applied to a phase transition. We need to analyze both the freezing and melting processes.

Freezing (liquid to solid): Freezing is exothermic (delta-H < 0) -- the energy row is favorable. But freezing decreases entropy (delta-S < 0) -- the entropy row is unfavorable. This is Case 3 (spontaneous at low temperature). Below 0 degrees C, the favorable energy row dominates the scorecard because the temperature weighting on the entropy row is small. The net score is negative -- freezing is spontaneous.

Melting (solid to liquid): Melting is endothermic (delta-H > 0) -- the energy row is unfavorable. But melting increases entropy (delta-S > 0) -- the entropy row is favorable. This is Case 4 (spontaneous at high temperature). Above 0 degrees C, the temperature weighting amplifies the favorable entropy row enough to override the unfavorable energy row. The net score is negative -- melting is spontaneous.

What is special about exactly 0 degrees C? At this precise temperature, the free energy scorecard comes out to exactly zero for both processes. The energy drive and the entropy drive are perfectly balanced. Neither freezing nor melting is favored -- the net score is zero in both directions. This means ice and liquid water coexist in equilibrium. Neither phase is converting into the other on a net basis (though at the molecular level, individual molecules are constantly freezing and melting -- the rates are just equal). The temperature 0 degrees C is the exact tipping point where the relative weighting of energy and entropy switches from favoring one phase to favoring the other.

### Chapter 3 (NRG): Section NRG.E, Question 3

**Question**: If a protein unfolds (denatures) at high temperature, what does that tell you about the free energy scorecard for protein folding? Which row of the scorecard changes as temperature increases?

**Model Answer**:

Using **free energy** reasoning (**DEF-NRG004**), the fact that proteins denature (unfold) at high temperature tells us that protein folding is spontaneous at normal body temperature (about 37 degrees C) but becomes non-spontaneous at sufficiently high temperatures. This pattern is characteristic of a process where energy and entropy conflict in a specific way.

For protein folding to be spontaneous at body temperature but non-spontaneous at fever temperatures, the scorecard must have a favorable energy row (folding is exothermic or involves favorable interactions -- new hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces form when the protein folds) and an unfavorable entropy row for the protein chain itself (the folded protein has fewer possible arrangements than the unfolded, floppy chain). This is Case 3: exothermic + entropy decrease = spontaneous at low temperature.

The row that changes as temperature increases is the **entropy drive row**. Temperature acts as a weighting factor for entropy. At body temperature (37 degrees C), the weighting on the entropy penalty is moderate enough that the favorable energy row dominates -- the scorecard is net negative, and folding is spontaneous. As temperature increases (fever, above approximately 40 degrees C), the entropy row gets weighted more heavily. The penalty for losing arrangements (going from floppy chain to rigid fold) now outweighs the energy gain from forming folding interactions. The scorecard flips to net positive -- folding is no longer spontaneous, and unfolding becomes favored. The protein denatures. This is one reason why very high fevers are medically dangerous: the molecular machinery of cells depends on properly folded proteins, and the free energy balance that maintains those folds shifts at elevated temperatures.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.1, Question 1

**Question**: A glass of iced tea sits on a table on a warm day. Condensation forms on the outside of the glass. Using macro-to-submicro translation (PRIM-SCL001), explain what is happening at the molecular level.

**Model Answer**:

Using **macro-to-submicro translation** (**PRIM-SCL001**), we start with the macroscopic observation -- water droplets appearing on the outside of the cold glass -- and explain it in terms of molecular behavior.

The air surrounding the glass contains water vapor: individual H2O molecules moving freely in the gas phase. The glass of iced tea is cold (near 0 degrees C), which means the surface of the glass is much colder than the surrounding air. When gas-phase water molecules in the warm, humid air come into contact with the cold glass surface, they lose kinetic energy. Their average speed decreases as thermal energy transfers from the fast-moving gas molecules to the cold glass (this is heat flow from hot to cold, as described in DEF-NRG001 from Chapter 3). Once enough kinetic energy is lost, these water molecules no longer have sufficient speed to remain in the gas phase. The intermolecular forces between water molecules -- specifically hydrogen bonds -- become strong enough relative to their kinetic energy to pull them together into the liquid phase. The molecules transition from gas to liquid on the glass surface, forming the visible water droplets you observe as condensation.

This is a top-down translation: the macroscopic observation (water droplets appear) is explained by the molecular events (gas-phase water molecules lose kinetic energy at the cold surface, hydrogen bonds pull them into the liquid phase). The process is also an illustration of entropy and energy principles from Chapter 3: condensation is exothermic (energy is released when gas molecules form liquid) and decreases entropy (liquid has fewer arrangements than gas), making it Case 3 from the spontaneity matrix -- spontaneous at the low temperature of the glass surface.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.1, Question 2

**Question**: Explain why a single molecule of ethanol (C2H5OH) does not have a boiling point. What kind of property is boiling point?

**Model Answer**:

A single molecule of ethanol does not have a boiling point because boiling point is an **emergent property** (**PRIM-SCL004**) -- a property that exists only at the collective level when enormous numbers of molecules interact, and has no meaning for a single isolated molecule.

Boiling is the process by which molecules in a liquid gain enough kinetic energy to overcome the intermolecular forces holding them together and escape into the gas phase. But this process requires a liquid to exist in the first place, which is itself a collective phenomenon -- a liquid is a state where trillions of molecules are interacting through intermolecular forces (in ethanol's case, hydrogen bonds at the O-H group and London dispersion forces along the hydrocarbon chain). A single ethanol molecule, alone in empty space, is not in a liquid phase. It is not being held by neighboring molecules. There is nothing to "escape from." The concepts of liquid, gas, and the transition between them (boiling) only arise when a vast population of molecules interacts collectively.

Boiling point meets all three criteria for an emergent property: (1) it does not exist for a single molecule in isolation, (2) it arises from the interactions among many molecules (specifically, the collective balance of kinetic energy and intermolecular forces across the population), and (3) it cannot be calculated by simply looking at one molecule's properties alone. You can determine a single ethanol molecule's mass (46.07 amu), its bond angles, and its molecular polarity -- these are non-emergent properties that belong to the individual molecule. But its boiling point (78.4 degrees C) is a collective, statistical outcome of how trillions of ethanol molecules behave together.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.1, Question 3

**Question**: Gold nanoparticles appear red in solution, while bulk gold appears yellow. Is color an emergent property of gold? Justify your answer using PRIM-SCL004.

**Model Answer**:

Yes, color is an emergent property of gold. Using **emergent property reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL004**), we can verify this by checking the three criteria for emergence.

First, a single gold atom does not have a "color" in the way we observe it macroscopically. Color is the result of how a material interacts with visible light -- which wavelengths are absorbed and which are reflected. A single gold atom can absorb and emit photons at specific wavelengths corresponding to electronic transitions, but the characteristic golden-yellow color we associate with gold requires the collective behavior of a vast number of atoms. In bulk gold, trillions of atoms share delocalized electrons (the "electron sea" of metallic bonding) that collectively interact with light, absorbing blue-violet wavelengths and reflecting yellow-red wavelengths. This collective electronic behavior produces the familiar yellow color.

Second, the color arises from interactions among many atoms, and it changes when the number of interacting atoms changes. Gold nanoparticles -- clusters of just a few thousand atoms -- appear red, not yellow. At this small scale, the collective electronic behavior is different from bulk gold because the delocalized electrons are confined to a much smaller space. Their interaction with light shifts to absorbing different wavelengths, producing a red appearance. This dramatic color change with particle size is direct evidence of emergence: the color is not an intrinsic property of gold atoms but a collective property that depends on how many atoms are interacting.

Third, you cannot predict the color by looking at a single atom. The bulk color (yellow) and the nanoparticle color (red) are qualitatively different from what any single atom produces. The whole behaves differently from any single part -- the hallmark of an emergent property.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.1, Question 4

**Question**: A student says, "Since water molecules are bent, water is a liquid at room temperature." What is missing from this reasoning? (Hint: think about the difference between a single-molecule property and a collective property.)

**Model Answer**:

The student's reasoning is incomplete because it jumps directly from a single-molecule property (bent geometry) to a bulk, collective property (being a liquid at room temperature) without accounting for the necessary intermediate steps. This gap is identified by **emergent property reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL004**) and **macro-to-submicro translation** (**PRIM-SCL001**).

The bent shape of water is a property of an individual molecule -- you can determine it by examining a single H2O molecule's electron groups and applying VSEPR geometry. However, being a liquid at room temperature is an emergent property that depends on the collective interactions among trillions of molecules. What is missing from the student's reasoning is the critical link: the bent shape of water makes the molecule polar (the bond dipoles do not cancel due to the bent geometry), and this polarity enables water molecules to form strong hydrogen bonds with one another. It is the collective network of hydrogen bonds among vast numbers of water molecules that holds them together tightly enough to maintain the liquid state at room temperature.

Many bent molecules are not liquids at room temperature. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is also bent, but it is a gas at room temperature because its intermolecular forces are much weaker (sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so H2S forms much weaker hydrogen bonds). The bent shape alone does not determine the phase. The complete reasoning chain requires: bent shape (single-molecule property) leads to molecular polarity leads to hydrogen bonding capability (intermolecular interaction) leads to strong collective intermolecular forces among trillions of molecules leads to liquid phase at room temperature (emergent, collective property). The student skipped from the first link to the last without acknowledging the collective, emergent nature of the liquid state.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.1, Question 5

**Question**: Use the three-level framework (macroscopic, submicroscopic, symbolic) to describe what happens when a drop of food coloring spreads through a glass of water.

**Model Answer**:

The three-level framework (Johnstone's triplet) provides three complementary descriptions of the same phenomenon, and translating among them is the core operation of **macro-to-submicro translation** (**PRIM-SCL001**).

**Macroscopic level** (what you observe with your senses): You place a drop of food coloring at the top of a glass of water. Initially, you see a concentrated blob of color. Over the next several minutes, the color slowly spreads outward in all directions, creating swirls and streaks. Eventually, the entire glass becomes a uniform, lighter shade of the dye color. No stirring is required -- the spreading happens on its own. The water does not get warmer or cooler during this process.

**Submicroscopic level** (what the molecules are doing): The food coloring molecules are initially clustered together in a small region of the glass. Both the water molecules and the dye molecules are in constant random thermal motion -- they are vibrating, rotating, and colliding with their neighbors in all directions. Through these random collisions, dye molecules gradually migrate away from the concentrated region into areas where there are fewer dye molecules. This random molecular motion (diffusion) causes the dye to spread. Using entropy reasoning from Chapter 3 (PRIM-NRG004), the dispersed state is overwhelmingly more probable than the concentrated state because there are astronomically more ways to arrange the dye molecules throughout the entire glass than in one small spot. The spreading is entropy-driven.

**Symbolic level** (how chemists represent it): Dye(concentrated, aq) -> Dye(dispersed, aq). The "(aq)" notation indicates the dye is dissolved in water. This symbolic representation captures the process concisely: the same substance, in the same phase, simply redistributing from a concentrated to a dispersed state. No new substances form -- this is a physical process, not a chemical reaction.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.2, Question 1

**Question**: Calculate the molar mass of aspirin (C9H8O4). If you have 1.80 grams of aspirin, how many moles is that?

**Model Answer**:

This problem uses the **mole concept** (**PRIM-SCL002**) and **unit analysis** (**PRIM-SCL006**) to bridge from a molecular formula to a macroscopic mass measurement.

Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of aspirin (C9H8O4) by adding up the atomic masses of all atoms in the formula, using values from the periodic table.

- Carbon (C): 9 atoms x 12.01 g/mol = 108.09 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 8 atoms x 1.008 g/mol = 8.064 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 4 atoms x 16.00 g/mol = 64.00 g/mol
- **Molar mass of aspirin = 108.09 + 8.064 + 64.00 = 180.15 g/mol**

Step 2: Convert 1.80 grams to moles using the molar mass as a conversion factor.

1.80 g C9H8O4 x (1 mol / 180.15 g) = **0.00999 mol**, or approximately **0.0100 mol** (1.00 x 10^-2 mol)

Using unit analysis to verify: the grams cancel (g in numerator, g in denominator of the conversion factor), leaving moles as the final unit -- exactly what we wanted. This result means that 1.80 grams of aspirin contains approximately 0.01 moles, which is 0.01 x 6.02 x 10^23 = about 6.0 x 10^21 molecules of aspirin. A standard aspirin tablet is 325 mg (0.325 g), so 1.80 grams is about 5.5 tablets' worth of aspirin -- a tangible, real-world amount that corresponds to an enormous but specific number of molecules.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.2, Question 2

**Question**: How many molecules are in 1.00 mole of carbon dioxide (CO2)? How many individual atoms is that? (Hint: each CO2 molecule contains 3 atoms.)

**Model Answer**:

This problem uses the **mole concept** (**PRIM-SCL002**) and **proportional reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL005**) to convert between moles, molecules, and atoms.

Step 1: Convert moles to molecules using Avogadro's number.

1.00 mol CO2 x (6.02 x 10^23 molecules / 1 mol) = **6.02 x 10^23 molecules** of CO2

This is simply the definition of the mole: 1 mole of anything contains 6.02 x 10^23 of those entities.

Step 2: Convert molecules to individual atoms. Each molecule of CO2 contains 3 atoms: 1 carbon atom and 2 oxygen atoms. Using proportional reasoning:

6.02 x 10^23 molecules x (3 atoms / 1 molecule) = **1.81 x 10^24 atoms** total

We can also break this down by element:
- Carbon atoms: 6.02 x 10^23 molecules x (1 C atom / molecule) = 6.02 x 10^23 carbon atoms
- Oxygen atoms: 6.02 x 10^23 molecules x (2 O atoms / molecule) = 1.20 x 10^24 oxygen atoms
- Total: 6.02 x 10^23 + 1.20 x 10^24 = 1.81 x 10^24 atoms (confirming our answer)

Using **unit analysis** (**PRIM-SCL006**): "molecules" cancels in the molecule-to-atom conversion, leaving "atoms" -- the correct unit. This problem illustrates the distinction between counting molecules and counting atoms. A mole of CO2 is always 6.02 x 10^23 molecules, but the number of atoms is three times larger because each molecule is itself composed of multiple atoms. Reading the chemical formula (PRIM-COM005 from Chapter 1) is essential: you must know the formula CO2 to know there are 3 atoms per molecule.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.2, Question 3

**Question**: A patient weighs 55 kg. A medication is prescribed at 10 mg per kg of body weight per day, given in two equal doses. How many milligrams per dose?

**Model Answer**:

This is a direct application of **proportional reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL005**) and **unit analysis** (**PRIM-SCL006**) in a medical context -- one of the most practically important applications of these reasoning moves.

Step 1: Calculate the total daily dose using the prescribed rate and the patient's weight.

10 mg/kg/day x 55 kg = 550 mg/day

Unit analysis check: mg/kg/day times kg -- the "kg" cancels, leaving mg/day. This is the correct unit for a daily dose.

Step 2: Divide the daily dose into two equal doses.

550 mg/day / 2 doses/day = **275 mg per dose**

Unit analysis check: mg/day divided by doses/day -- the "day" cancels, leaving mg/dose. This is the correct unit.

This type of calculation is performed by pharmacists, nurses, and physicians daily. The proportional reasoning is identical to what you use in chemistry (scaling a recipe by a ratio) and in everyday life (if 10 cookies need 2 eggs, then 30 cookies need 6 eggs). The critical difference in a medical context is that errors have serious consequences. An accidental factor-of-ten error -- giving 2,750 mg instead of 275 mg -- could be toxic. This is precisely why **unit analysis** is so valuable as an error-detection tool: if your answer comes out in the wrong units (say, kg-mg instead of mg), you know immediately that something went wrong. Dimensional analysis is not just a classroom exercise; it is a safety discipline used in healthcare every day.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.2, Question 4

**Question**: Convert 500 mL of a solution to liters using dimensional analysis. Show the units cancelling.

**Model Answer**:

This is a straightforward application of **unit analysis** (**PRIM-SCL006**) -- dimensional analysis used for unit conversion.

We need to go from milliliters (mL) to liters (L). The conversion factor is: 1 L = 1,000 mL. We set up the conversion so that the starting unit (mL) appears in the denominator of the conversion factor and cancels:

500 mL x (1 L / 1,000 mL) = 0.500 L

Showing the units cancelling explicitly: the unit "mL" appears in the numerator (500 mL) and in the denominator of the conversion factor (1,000 mL). These cancel, leaving only "L" -- liters -- as the surviving unit. This is exactly the desired target unit, confirming the calculation is set up correctly.

If you had accidentally inverted the conversion factor -- writing (1,000 mL / 1 L) instead of (1 L / 1,000 mL) -- you would get: 500 mL x (1,000 mL / 1 L) = 500,000 mL^2/L, which is a nonsensical unit. The dimensional analysis immediately catches this error before you ever report an answer. This is why the factor-label method is so powerful: even for simple conversions, it provides a built-in error check. In more complex multi-step problems (such as converting grams to moles to molecules), this error-detection capability becomes indispensable.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.2, Question 5

**Question**: You have 100.0 grams of table salt (NaCl, molar mass 58.44 g/mol). How many moles of NaCl is this? How many formula units?

**Model Answer**:

This problem uses the **mole concept** (**PRIM-SCL002**) to bridge from a macroscopic mass measurement to the submicroscopic world of individual particles, with **unit analysis** (**PRIM-SCL006**) as the error-checking tool.

Step 1: Convert grams to moles.

100.0 g NaCl x (1 mol / 58.44 g) = **1.711 mol NaCl**

Unit analysis: grams cancel (g in numerator, g in denominator), leaving mol -- correct.

Step 2: Convert moles to formula units using Avogadro's number. (Note: we say "formula units" rather than "molecules" because NaCl is an ionic compound -- it forms a crystal lattice of alternating Na+ and Cl- ions, not discrete molecules. Each formula unit represents one Na+ and one Cl-.)

1.711 mol x (6.02 x 10^23 formula units / 1 mol) = **1.030 x 10^24 formula units**

Unit analysis: mol cancels, leaving formula units -- correct.

To put this in perspective, 100.0 grams of table salt is roughly 6-7 tablespoons -- the amount you might use over a few weeks of cooking. That modest kitchen quantity contains over one septillion (1.03 x 10^24) individual Na+ and Cl- ion pairs. This enormous number illustrates why the mole was invented: there is no practical way to count individual formula units, but by weighing 100.0 grams on a balance, you have effectively counted them. The mole concept and the periodic table together turn a kitchen scale into a particle counter, bridging the macroscopic world you can touch to the submicroscopic world you cannot see (**PRIM-SCL001**).

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.3, Question 1

**Question**: You dissolve 4.00 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, molar mass 40.00 g/mol) in enough water to make 250.0 mL of solution. What is the molarity?

**Model Answer**:

This problem uses the **mole concept** (**PRIM-SCL002**) to convert grams to moles, then the **molarity** definition (**DEF-SCL001**) to calculate concentration, with **unit analysis** (**PRIM-SCL006**) verifying each step.

Step 1: Convert grams of NaOH to moles.

4.00 g NaOH x (1 mol / 40.00 g) = 0.100 mol NaOH

Unit analysis: grams cancel, leaving moles -- correct.

Step 2: Convert the volume from mL to L (since molarity is defined as mol/L).

250.0 mL x (1 L / 1,000 mL) = 0.2500 L

Step 3: Calculate molarity.

M = moles of solute / liters of solution = 0.100 mol / 0.2500 L = **0.400 M NaOH**

This means that every liter of this solution contains 0.400 moles of sodium hydroxide. Equivalently, each 250 mL portion contains 0.100 moles. Sodium hydroxide is a strong base commonly used in drain cleaners (at high concentrations) and in soap-making. At 0.400 M, this solution would be mildly corrosive -- concentrated enough for laboratory use in a neutralization experiment but dilute enough to handle with standard safety precautions (gloves and goggles). This calculation is precisely what a chemist does when preparing a solution of known concentration: weigh out a specific mass of solute, dissolve it, and calculate the resulting molarity using **concentration reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL003**).

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.3, Question 2

**Question**: You need 500.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl. Your stock solution is 6.00 M HCl. How many mL of stock solution do you need? (Use M1V1 = M2V2.)

**Model Answer**:

This is a dilution problem that uses **concentration reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL003**), specifically the dilution formula, and **proportional reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL005**).

The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2, which works because the total amount of solute (moles = M x V) does not change during dilution -- you are just spreading the same solute into more solvent.

Identify the known values:
- M1 = 6.00 M (stock solution concentration)
- V1 = ? (volume of stock solution needed -- what we are solving for)
- M2 = 0.100 M (desired final concentration)
- V2 = 500.0 mL (desired final volume)

Plug into M1V1 = M2V2:

(6.00 M)(V1) = (0.100 M)(500.0 mL)

V1 = (0.100 M x 500.0 mL) / 6.00 M = 50.0 mL / 6.00 = **8.33 mL**

Unit analysis: M (mol/L) cancels on both sides, leaving mL -- correct.

To prepare this solution, you would measure 8.33 mL of the concentrated 6.00 M HCl stock solution and add enough water to bring the total volume to 500.0 mL. The key insight is that those 8.33 mL of concentrated acid contain the same number of moles of HCl as the final 500.0 mL of dilute solution: 0.100 M x 0.500 L = 0.0500 mol. Check: 6.00 M x 0.00833 L = 0.0500 mol. The moles match -- the books balance. This is exactly the kind of calculation a lab technician, pharmacist, or water treatment engineer performs routinely. Safety note: when diluting concentrated acids, always add acid to water (not water to acid) to avoid dangerous spattering from the exothermic mixing process.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.3, Question 3

**Question**: A water sample contains lead at 8 ppb. Is this above or below the EPA action level of 15 ppb? What if a second sample reads 22 ppb?

**Model Answer**:

This problem uses **concentration reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL003**) and **parts per million/billion** interpretation (**DEF-SCL002**) to compare measured concentrations against a regulatory threshold.

The first sample reads 8 ppb of lead. The EPA action level for lead in drinking water is 15 ppb. Since 8 ppb < 15 ppb, the first sample is **below** the EPA action level. In concentration terms, 8 ppb means 8 micrograms of lead per liter of water -- an extraordinarily small amount, invisible and tasteless, but measurable with sensitive analytical instruments. At this level, the water meets the regulatory standard.

The second sample reads 22 ppb. Since 22 ppb > 15 ppb, this sample **exceeds** the EPA action level. At 22 ppb, regulatory action is required -- the water system must take steps to reduce lead levels, such as treating the water to reduce corrosivity, replacing lead service lines, or notifying customers.

It is critical to note that both concentrations describe vanishingly small amounts of lead in absolute terms. The difference between 8 and 22 micrograms per liter -- just 14 micrograms, an amount invisible to the naked eye -- is the difference between "within guidelines" and "regulatory violation." This is precisely why parts-per-billion reasoning matters. As the Flint water crisis demonstrated, lead at concentrations of 100+ ppb caused serious public health harm, particularly to children's developing neurological systems. The EPA threshold of 15 ppb is not arbitrary; it is based on decades of epidemiological research showing that chronic low-level lead exposure causes measurable cognitive and developmental harm. Using **safety and risk reasoning** (**DEF-SCL005**), the hazard of lead is high (it is a neurotoxin), so even very low concentrations pose meaningful risk with chronic exposure.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.3, Question 4

**Question**: Convert 5.0 ppm of dissolved calcium (Ca2+) to mg/L. Then estimate the molarity. (Molar mass of Ca = 40.08 g/mol.)

**Model Answer**:

This problem chains together **parts per million** interpretation (**DEF-SCL002**), **molarity** calculation (**DEF-SCL001**), and **unit analysis** (**PRIM-SCL006**).

Step 1: Convert ppm to mg/L. For dilute aqueous solutions, 1 ppm is approximately equal to 1 mg/L. Therefore:

5.0 ppm Ca2+ = **5.0 mg/L**

This approximation holds because the density of dilute aqueous solutions is close to 1 g/mL, making 1 part per million (1 mg per 1,000,000 mg of solution) equivalent to 1 mg per liter.

Step 2: Convert mg/L to g/L, then to molarity.

5.0 mg/L x (1 g / 1,000 mg) = 0.0050 g/L

Now calculate molarity using the molar mass of calcium (40.08 g/mol):

M = (0.0050 g/L) / (40.08 g/mol) = **1.2 x 10^-4 M** (or 0.00012 M)

Unit analysis: g/L divided by g/mol gives mol/L (= M) -- correct.

This result illustrates why ppm is more convenient than molarity for trace-level concentrations. "5.0 ppm calcium" is simple, intuitive, and easy to compare with other ppm values. "1.2 x 10^-4 M calcium" conveys the same information but is harder to communicate and compare. In drinking water analysis, calcium at 5 ppm is well within normal ranges (typical drinking water has 10-100 ppm calcium). This kind of conversion is necessary when a water treatment engineer needs to perform chemical calculations (which use molarity) based on water quality data (which is reported in ppm).

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.3, Question 5

**Question**: A student says, "10 ppb is basically zero -- it cannot matter." Respond to this claim using the Flint water crisis as evidence.

**Model Answer**:

This claim is dangerously wrong, and the Flint water crisis provides devastating evidence of why. Using **concentration reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL003**), **parts per billion** interpretation (**DEF-SCL002**), and **safety and risk reasoning** (**DEF-SCL005**), we can dismantle this misconception.

Ten parts per billion sounds negligibly small in everyday terms -- it is 10 micrograms per liter, roughly equivalent to one drop of ink in a small swimming pool. But whether a concentration "matters" depends on the substance's hazard, the route of exposure, and the duration. Lead is a potent neurotoxin. It accumulates in the body over time (chronic exposure), and it is particularly harmful to children's developing brains. There is no known safe level of lead exposure for children. The EPA action level of 15 ppb is not a "safe" level -- it is an action trigger, meaning that when lead exceeds 15 ppb, the water system must intervene.

In Flint, Michigan, in 2014, the city switched its water source to the Flint River. The new water was more corrosive and leached lead from aging pipes. Lead levels in some homes exceeded 100 ppb -- but even levels of 20-50 ppb, still tiny in absolute terms, were associated with elevated blood lead levels in children, developmental delays, and long-term neurological harm. The crisis affected tens of thousands of residents over several years.

The student's error is thinking that "small number = no effect." This reasoning fails for substances with high intrinsic hazard and chronic exposure pathways. At 10 ppb, you are consuming 10 micrograms of lead with every liter of water you drink. Over a year, drinking 2 liters per day, that is 7,300 micrograms (7.3 mg) of a cumulative neurotoxin. The concentration is small; the total exposure over time is not. Risk depends on hazard, concentration, route, AND duration -- not on concentration alone.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.4, Question 1

**Question**: A balanced equation shows: 2 mol of aluminum (Al) reacts with 3 mol of chlorine gas (Cl2) to form 2 mol of aluminum chloride (AlCl3). If you start with 4.0 mol of Al, how many moles of Cl2 do you need?

**Model Answer**:

This is a direct application of **proportional reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL005**) using the mole ratios from a balanced chemical equation.

The balanced equation gives us the mole ratio: 2 mol Al : 3 mol Cl2 : 2 mol AlCl3. This ratio is the "recipe" -- just like a cookie recipe that says 2 cups flour per 1 cup sugar, the chemical equation says 2 mol Al per 3 mol Cl2.

We are scaling up from 2 mol Al (the recipe amount) to 4.0 mol Al (the actual amount). The scaling factor is:

4.0 mol Al / 2 mol Al = 2.0

We started with twice the recipe amount of aluminum, so we need twice the recipe amount of chlorine gas:

3 mol Cl2 x 2.0 = **6.0 mol Cl2**

Alternatively, using the proportional reasoning template (a/b = c/d):

2 mol Al / 3 mol Cl2 = 4.0 mol Al / x mol Cl2

Solving: x = (4.0 x 3) / 2 = 6.0 mol Cl2

The logic is identical to scaling a recipe. If the recipe says "2 eggs and 3 cups of flour make 24 cookies" and you want to use 4 eggs, you need 6 cups of flour. The mole ratio from the balanced equation is the chemical recipe, and the **mole concept** (**PRIM-SCL002**) provides the bridge between these molecular-level ratios and macroscopic quantities you could weigh in a lab. If you needed to know the mass: 6.0 mol Cl2 x 70.90 g/mol = 425 g of chlorine gas.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.4, Question 2

**Question**: Caffeine has an LD50 of about 192 mg/kg. A person weighs 70 kg. What total dose would correspond to the LD50? If a cup of coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine, approximately how many cups would that be? (Note: this is a mathematical exercise, not medical advice.)

**Model Answer**:

This problem uses **proportional reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL005**), **unit analysis** (**PRIM-SCL006**), and **safety and risk reasoning** (**DEF-SCL005**).

Step 1: Calculate the total LD50 dose for a 70 kg person.

192 mg/kg x 70 kg = **13,440 mg** (approximately 13,400 mg or 13.4 g)

Unit analysis: mg/kg x kg -- the kg cancels, leaving mg. Correct.

Step 2: Convert to number of cups of coffee.

13,440 mg / 95 mg per cup = **approximately 141 cups** of coffee

This calculation illustrates the Paracelsus principle ("the dose makes the poison") quantitatively. Caffeine is a moderately toxic substance -- its LD50 (192 mg/kg) puts it between table salt (3,000 mg/kg, low toxicity) and nicotine (50 mg/kg, high toxicity). Yet the typical concentration of caffeine in a cup of coffee (95 mg) is so far below the lethal threshold for a human adult that you would need to drink roughly 141 cups in a short period to reach the LD50 dose. At normal consumption (1-4 cups per day), the risk from caffeine is very low despite its moderate hazard.

This is a perfect example of the hazard-versus-risk distinction from **DEF-SCL005**. The hazard of caffeine is moderate (LD50 = 192 mg/kg). The risk at normal coffee consumption is very low because the concentration of caffeine per cup, divided by body weight, puts you at roughly 1.4 mg/kg per cup -- less than 1% of the LD50. However, concentrated caffeine supplements (caffeine pills or powder) can bring you much closer to dangerous doses, which is why such products require careful dosing instructions. Same substance, same hazard -- but the risk depends entirely on concentration and amount consumed.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.4, Question 3

**Question**: Two substances have LD50 values of 5 mg/kg and 5000 mg/kg, respectively. Which is more toxic? By what factor?

**Model Answer**:

Using **safety and risk reasoning** (**DEF-SCL005**) and **proportional reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL005**), we compare the two LD50 values.

The substance with an LD50 of **5 mg/kg is more toxic**. Remember that LD50 is the dose lethal to 50% of test animals -- a lower LD50 means less of the substance is needed to cause harm, which means the substance is more acutely toxic.

The substance with LD50 = 5 mg/kg requires only 5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight to reach the lethal threshold. The substance with LD50 = 5,000 mg/kg requires 5,000 milligrams per kilogram -- one thousand times more substance to achieve the same lethal effect.

The toxicity factor is:

5,000 mg/kg / 5 mg/kg = **1,000 times more toxic** (the substance with LD50 = 5 mg/kg)

To put this in context using the table from the chapter: an LD50 of 5 mg/kg falls near sodium cyanide (LD50 = 6 mg/kg) -- very high toxicity. An LD50 of 5,000 mg/kg falls near acetone (LD50 = 5,800 mg/kg) -- very low acute toxicity. The 1,000-fold difference means that while you might handle the low-toxicity substance with minimal precautions (like acetone for nail polish removal), the high-toxicity substance would require extreme caution: full personal protective equipment, controlled access, and rigorous protocols. The LD50 number is the intrinsic hazard; the actual risk depends on how much you are exposed to and by what route, but the thousand-fold difference in hazard demands a correspondingly different level of safety precaution.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.4, Question 4

**Question**: A student plans to use acetone to clean lab equipment in a small, closed room for 4 hours. The PEL for acetone is 1000 ppm. What concerns would you raise? What would you recommend?

**Model Answer**:

This scenario requires **safety and risk reasoning** (**DEF-SCL005**), combining the intrinsic hazard of acetone with the specific exposure conditions (concentration, route, and duration).

The hazard profile of acetone: The LD50 is 5,800 mg/kg (low acute toxicity), and the GHS pictograms indicate it is flammable and an irritant. The PEL (Permissible Exposure Limit) of 1,000 ppm is the maximum allowable airborne concentration for an 8-hour workday.

The risk assessment for this specific scenario raises several concerns. First, **concentration**: In a small, closed room with no ventilation, acetone vapor will accumulate as the student uses it continuously over 4 hours. Acetone is volatile -- it evaporates readily at room temperature. Without airflow to dilute and remove the vapor, the airborne concentration could approach or even exceed 1,000 ppm, particularly in a small space. Second, **duration**: Four hours is a substantial exposure period -- half of the 8-hour window the PEL is designed for. Even if the concentration stays below 1,000 ppm, prolonged exposure can cause headaches, dizziness, and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Third, **route**: The primary exposure route is inhalation of acetone vapor, which is absorbed through the lungs into the bloodstream. Fourth, **flammability**: Acetone vapor is highly flammable. In a closed room, accumulated vapor could reach flammable concentrations, creating a fire or explosion risk from any ignition source (a spark, a hot plate, static discharge).

Recommendations: (1) Open windows or doors to provide ventilation, or better yet, perform this work in a fume hood. (2) Take regular breaks outside the room to reduce cumulative exposure. (3) Remove all ignition sources from the room. (4) Wear appropriate PPE (chemical splash goggles, nitrile gloves). (5) Consider whether a less volatile solvent could accomplish the same cleaning task. The substance has not changed; the risk is elevated because of the confined space, long duration, and poor ventilation.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.4, Question 5

**Question**: A recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of lemon juice for 6 servings. You need 15 servings. How much lemon juice do you need? What reasoning move are you using?

**Model Answer**:

This problem uses **proportional reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL005**) -- the same reasoning move that chemists use to scale reactions from the molecular level to the laboratory bench.

The recipe gives a ratio: 3 tablespoons of lemon juice per 6 servings. We need to scale this up to 15 servings.

Method 1 -- Scaling factor:
Scaling factor = 15 servings / 6 servings = 2.5
Lemon juice needed = 3 tablespoons x 2.5 = **7.5 tablespoons**

Method 2 -- Proportional reasoning template (a/b = c/d):
3 tablespoons / 6 servings = x tablespoons / 15 servings
x = (3 x 15) / 6 = 45 / 6 = **7.5 tablespoons**

Both methods give the same answer because they are the same cognitive operation expressed differently.

The reasoning move is **proportional reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL005**). This is precisely the same operation used in chemistry when scaling mole ratios from a balanced equation to laboratory quantities. If a balanced equation says "2 mol H2 reacts with 1 mol O2" and you need 5 mol of O2, you scale up: (2 mol H2 / 1 mol O2) x 5 mol O2 = 10 mol H2. The ratio is the recipe; the scaling is the proportional reasoning. The only difference between scaling a cooking recipe and scaling a chemical reaction is the unit: tablespoons and servings in the kitchen become moles and grams in the lab. The mathematical logic is identical. This is one of the most domain-general quantitative skills in the course -- it appears in cooking, pharmacy, engineering, finance, and chemistry.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.E, Question 1

**Question**: A balloon is inflated at room temperature (about 22 degrees C or 295 K) and then placed in a freezer at -18 degrees C (255 K). Predict qualitatively: will the balloon expand or shrink? Which gas law relationship are you using?

**Model Answer**:

Using **ideal gas reasoning** (**DEF-SCL003**), specifically Charles's Law, the balloon will **shrink**.

Charles's Law describes the relationship between volume and temperature when pressure and the amount of gas (moles) are held constant. It states: at constant P and n, volume and temperature are directly related -- when temperature increases, volume increases, and when temperature decreases, volume decreases.

In this scenario, the balloon is moved from room temperature (295 K) to the freezer (-18 degrees C = 255 K). The temperature decreases. The amount of gas inside the balloon (n) does not change -- no gas escapes or enters. The external pressure (approximately 1 atm) stays roughly constant. Applying Charles's Law: since T decreases while P and n remain constant, V must decrease. The balloon shrinks.

At the molecular level (**PRIM-SCL001**, macro-to-submicro translation), this makes sense. Temperature is the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules inside the balloon. When the balloon is placed in the freezer, the gas molecules slow down -- they have less kinetic energy. Slower-moving molecules collide with the balloon walls less forcefully and less frequently. The external atmospheric pressure, which has not changed, now pushes inward more than the internal gas pressure pushes outward. The balloon contracts until the internal pressure (from fewer, softer collisions spread over a smaller area) balances the external pressure again. The balloon is not leaking; the gas is simply occupying less space because the molecules are moving more slowly. Bringing the balloon back to room temperature would restore its original volume.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.E, Question 2

**Question**: Explain why a bag of chips puffs up on an airplane using the ideal gas law. Which variable(s) change, and which stay approximately constant?

**Model Answer**:

Using **ideal gas reasoning** (**DEF-SCL003**), specifically Boyle's Law, we can explain this familiar phenomenon.

A bag of chips is sealed at the factory at roughly sea-level atmospheric pressure (about 1 atm or 101.3 kPa). The gas inside the bag -- mostly nitrogen, pumped in to keep the chips fresh and prevent crushing -- is at the same pressure as the surrounding air when sealed.

On an airplane at cruising altitude, the cabin is pressurized but not to full sea-level pressure. Typical cabin pressure is equivalent to about 6,000-8,000 feet elevation, roughly 0.75-0.80 atm. The key variables:

- **n (moles of gas)**: Stays constant. The bag is sealed -- no gas enters or leaves.
- **T (temperature)**: Stays approximately constant (cabin temperature is controlled, and we are analyzing the pressure-volume relationship).
- **P (external pressure)**: Decreases from about 1 atm at sea level to about 0.75-0.80 atm in the cabin.
- **V (volume of gas in the bag)**: This is what changes.

Applying Boyle's Law (constant T and n): when P decreases, V increases. The gas inside the sealed bag was compressed to a certain volume at 1 atm. At 0.80 atm, the same number of gas molecules exert the same force as before, but the external pressure pushing back is weaker. The gas expands until internal and external pressures equalize. The bag puffs up.

Using **macro-to-submicro translation** (**PRIM-SCL001**): the gas molecules inside the bag are still moving at the same speed (same temperature) and colliding with the bag walls with the same force. But the air molecules outside the bag are now exerting less inward pressure. The internal collisions push the bag outward more than the external collisions push inward, and the bag expands. It re-equilibrates at a larger volume where the internal pressure (same molecules in a bigger space = fewer collisions per unit area) matches the reduced cabin pressure.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.E, Question 3

**Question**: Per mole of solute dissolved, rank these from least to greatest freezing point depression: sugar (i = 1), NaCl (i = 2), CaCl2 (i = 3).

**Model Answer**:

Using **colligative property** reasoning (**DEF-SCL004**), freezing point depression depends on the total number of dissolved particles, not on the identity of those particles. The van't Hoff factor (i) tells us how many particles each formula unit produces when dissolved.

The ranking from least to greatest freezing point depression per mole of solute dissolved:

1. **Sugar (i = 1)** -- least depression. Sugar (C12H22O11) is a molecular compound. It dissolves as intact molecules and does not dissociate into ions. One mole of sugar produces 1 mole of dissolved particles.

2. **NaCl (i = 2)** -- intermediate depression. Sodium chloride is an ionic compound that dissociates into Na+ and Cl- when dissolved. One mole of NaCl produces 2 moles of dissolved particles (1 mol Na+ + 1 mol Cl-).

3. **CaCl2 (i = 3)** -- greatest depression. Calcium chloride dissociates into Ca2+ and 2 Cl- when dissolved. One mole of CaCl2 produces 3 moles of dissolved particles (1 mol Ca2+ + 2 mol Cl-).

Since freezing point depression is proportional to the total concentration of dissolved particles (a colligative property -- it depends on particle count, not identity), CaCl2 is the most effective at lowering the freezing point per mole of solute, followed by NaCl, then sugar. This is why calcium chloride is preferred over sodium chloride for de-icing roads in extremely cold conditions. Per mole dissolved, CaCl2 produces 50% more particles than NaCl (3 versus 2), giving it greater freezing point depression power. Using **proportional reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL005**), CaCl2 depresses the freezing point by a factor of 3/2 = 1.5 times more per mole than NaCl, and 3 times more per mole than sugar.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.E, Question 4

**Question**: A student says, "Salt melts ice because salt is hot." Correct this misconception using colligative property reasoning.

**Model Answer**:

This is incorrect. Salt at room temperature is not meaningfully "hot" -- it is at the same temperature as the ice and the surrounding environment. The mechanism by which salt melts ice has nothing to do with thermal energy being transferred from the salt to the ice. Using **colligative property** reasoning (**DEF-SCL004**), the correct explanation is fundamentally different.

When salt (NaCl) is placed on ice, some of the surface ice melts (even at temperatures below 0 degrees C, there is a thin film of liquid water on the surface of ice). The salt dissolves in this thin film, producing Na+ and Cl- ions. These dissolved particles disrupt the ability of water molecules to form the orderly crystal lattice required for the solid (ice) phase. The dissolved ions physically get in the way of the hydrogen-bond network that holds ice together.

This disruption lowers the freezing point of the solution. Pure water freezes at 0 degrees C, but the salt solution freezes at a lower temperature (how much lower depends on the concentration of dissolved particles -- this is the colligative effect). If the ambient temperature is, say, -5 degrees C, pure water would be frozen. But the salt solution has a freezing point below -5 degrees C, so it remains liquid. As more ice contacts the salt solution, it melts into the liquid phase because the ice is now above the freezing point of the solution. The process continues as long as the temperature is above the depressed freezing point.

This is an **emergent property** (**PRIM-SCL004**) in action: the freezing point depression does not depend on the chemical identity of the salt (NaCl, CaCl2, or sugar would all work) but on the number of dissolved particles. The salt is not providing heat; it is providing particles that change the collective thermodynamic behavior of the water-ice system.

### Chapter 4 (SCL): Section SCL.E, Question 5

**Question**: Would you expect ethylene glycol (a molecular compound, i = 1) or potassium chloride (KCl, i = 2) to be more effective at depressing the freezing point per mole of solute dissolved? Why?

**Model Answer**:

Using **colligative property** reasoning (**DEF-SCL004**) and **proportional reasoning** (**PRIM-SCL005**), **potassium chloride (KCl, i = 2) would be more effective at depressing the freezing point per mole of solute dissolved.**

The reasoning is straightforward. Colligative properties depend on the total number of dissolved particles, not on the chemical identity of those particles. The van't Hoff factor (i) tells us how many particles one formula unit produces upon dissolving:

- Ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) is a molecular compound. It dissolves as intact molecules and does not dissociate into ions. Therefore, i = 1. One mole of ethylene glycol produces 1 mole of dissolved particles.

- Potassium chloride (KCl) is an ionic compound. When dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and Cl-. Therefore, i = 2. One mole of KCl produces 2 moles of dissolved particles.

Since freezing point depression is proportional to the total concentration of dissolved particles, KCl produces twice as many particles per mole as ethylene glycol. Per mole of solute, KCl is therefore twice as effective at depressing the freezing point.

However, this analysis considers only the per-mole effectiveness. In practice, other factors matter. Ethylene glycol is the standard antifreeze in car radiators, not KCl, because ethylene glycol is miscible with water in all proportions (you can dissolve as much as you want), it is non-corrosive to metal engine parts, and it provides both freezing point depression and boiling point elevation at the high concentrations used (about 50% by volume). KCl, while more effective per mole, would corrode metal engine components and has limited solubility. This illustrates that **safety and risk reasoning** (**DEF-SCL005**) and practical considerations must supplement the purely thermodynamic colligative analysis when choosing real-world solutions.
