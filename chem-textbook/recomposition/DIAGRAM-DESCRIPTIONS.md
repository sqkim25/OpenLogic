### Figure 1.4: Substance Classification Flowchart
- **Placement**: After PRIM-COM004 (COM.3)
- **Content**: Decision tree flowchart. Start: "Is it a pure substance or a mixture?" Branch left (pure substance): "Is it made of one type of atom?" → Yes: Element → No: Compound. Branch right (mixture): "Is it uniform throughout?" → Yes: Homogeneous mixture (solution) → No: Heterogeneous mixture. Examples at each terminal node: Element (gold bar), Compound (water), Homogeneous (salt water), Heterogeneous (salad).
