## 1. The textbook landscape is an oligopoly of one idea

General chemistry textbooks have converged on a single organizational philosophy — the empirical-to-theory progression — despite decades of reform rhetoric. Brown, LeMay, Bursten's _Chemistry: The Central Science_ (Pearson, 15th ed.) and its competitors hold **~75-80% of the market**. Cooper and Klymkowsky observed in 2013 that "the history of general chemistry is one of almost constant calls for reform, yet over the past 60 years little of substance has changed."

Five alternative paradigms have been attempted:

**Atoms-first** (~15-20% market share) is the only challenger to achieve scale. It inverts the traditional sequence by starting with atomic structure, then building to reactions and stoichiometry. Every major publisher now offers an atoms-first edition. ACS exams test content rather than sequence, so atoms-first courses can use standard ACS exams — Molina (2014, UNT dissertation) found atoms-first students actually outperformed traditional students on the 2005 ACS exam. But atoms-first changes only the _order_, not the _organizational logic_. It remains a linear topic march.

**Context-led/applications-first** (_Chemistry in Context_, ACS, 10th ed.; _Chemistry for Changing Times_, Hill & McCreary) dominates the non-majors niche. Chemical principles appear on a "need-to-know" basis, motivated by real-world issues. Stable in its niche but walled off from the majors market by perceived lack of rigor.

**POGIL** (Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) has reached over 1,000 U.S. institutions and reduced attrition rates from 22% to 10% (Farrell, Moog, Spencer, 1999), but it is a pedagogical method, not a content architecture — POGIL activities typically supplement a traditional textbook.

**Systems thinking** (Mahaffy et al., _Nature Reviews Chemistry_, 2018; Talanquer & Szozda, _J. Chem. Educ._, 2024) is conceptually compelling but embryonic. No textbook exists.

**Modular/network-structured** approaches (Spencer, Bodner & Rickard's _Chemistry: Structure and Dynamics_, Wiley) failed commercially. Students preferred coherent narrative over choose-your-own-path formats.

**No physics-first/quantum-first general chemistry textbook has gained traction.** The mathematical prerequisites are insurmountable for the gen-chem population.

### Takeaways
- Changing topic _order_ (atoms-first) is adoptable; changing _organizational logic_ is far harder.
- The non-majors space is underserved — its dominant texts are decades-old applications-first approaches.
- CLUE (Cooper & Klymkowsky, Michigan State) is the closest precedent for a structurally different gen-chem course, organized around four core ideas rather than ~15 traditional topics. But CLUE targets STEM majors.

## 2. Applications-first engages but does not transfer

Bennett, Lubben, and Hogarth's 2007 systematic review of 17 experimental studies from 8 countries found that context-based approaches produce **understanding "comparable to" conventional approaches** — not superior. The primary benefit was attitudinal.

Six documented failure modes:

1. **Situatedness paradox**: The very feature that makes applications engaging — anchoring chemistry in a specific scenario — binds learning to that scenario. (Brown, Collins & Duguid, 1989; Renkl, Mandl, Gruber, 1996)
2. **Missing bridge**: Applications-first texts "hug" (near transfer) but rarely "bridge" (far transfer). (Perkins & Salomon, 1992)
3. **Context overwhelming concept development**: Germany's ChiK project found teachers prioritized context over concepts; students reported "getting lost in the context." (Parchmann et al., 2006)
4. **Rapid obsolescence**: Application content dates between editions.
5. **Prerequisite overrun**: Applications often require more advanced chemistry than gen-chem provides.
6. **Assessment misalignment**: Standardized tests don't capture what context-based learning does well.

### Takeaways
- Applications should be _contexts for deploying reasoning primitives_, not the organizational backbone.
- Every application must include explicit "bridging" activities — prompts that force abstraction of the general principle.
- The same reasoning primitive should appear across multiple, diverse applications so students detach the principle from any single context.

## 3. Seven reasoning moves define chemical thinking

The CER literature converges on core cognitive operations that distinguish expert chemists from novices:

1. **Multi-scale representational reasoning**: Johnstone's triplet (macro, submicro, symbolic) + Mahaffy's tetrahedron (adds human/societal context). Chemists "jump freely from level to level" (Johnstone, 1982).

2. **Structure-property reasoning**: Connecting molecular architecture to observable properties. CLUE's central thread. (Cooper et al.)

3. **Causal-mechanistic reasoning**: Explaining _how_ and _why_ chemical changes occur by tracing entities, properties, interactions, and sequences. "The epistemic engine of chemistry." (Stowe & Cooper; Talanquer, 2018)

4. **Energy-driven reasoning**: Energy as the currency of chemical change — storage, transfer, transformation, and the thermodynamic/kinetic distinction. (Cooper & Klymkowsky, 2013)

5. **Dynamic equilibrium and statistical reasoning**: Macroscopic behavior emerges from probabilistic molecular behavior. Threshold schemas: static→dynamic, deterministic→probabilistic. (Talanquer, 2015)

6. **Conservation reasoning**: Tracking matter, energy, and charge through transformations. The quantitative backbone.

7. **Systems and emergent reasoning**: Macroscopic properties emerge from molecular interactions in non-additive ways. Threshold schemas: additive→emergent, centralized→decentralized. (Talanquer; Mahaffy et al., 2018)

### Talanquer's five threshold schemas (ontological shifts students must undergo):
- Additive → Emergent
- Continuous → Discrete
- Static → Dynamic
- Deterministic → Probabilistic
- Centralized → Decentralized

### Takeaways
- These seven reasoning moves are the candidate primitives.
- Talanquer's threshold schemas could function as the "type system" of the architecture.
- A non-majors course might focus on 4-5 of the seven moves, prioritizing scale-bridging, structure-property, and energy-driven reasoning.

## 4. Structural curricula work — chemistry is least penetrated

**Modeling Instruction (physics)**: Organized around 6-8 named models. Across >20,000 students, expert modelers' classes averaged 69% on the FCI vs 42% for traditional. At FIU, MI students were **6.73x as likely to succeed**. Strong equity gains. (Hestenes, 1987-present; Brewe et al., 2010)

**CLUE**: Reduced gen-chem to four core disciplinary ideas. Higher grades, lower DFW rates, significantly better causal reasoning. Adopted at Michigan State for all gen-chem since 2014. (Cooper & Klymkowsky)

**Chemical Thinking** (Talanquer, U. Arizona): Organized around essential questions and six reasoning dimensions. Students outperformed on both ACS exams and conceptual inventories. (Talanquer & Pollard, 2017)

**Chi's ontological category theory**: Many robust science misconceptions arise from ontological miscategorization (treating processes as substances). Explicit ontology training improved conceptual understanding. (Chi, 1992, 2005; Slotta & Chi, 2006)

**Vision and Change (biology)**: Five core concepts and six competencies reshaped undergraduate biology nationwide. But no single textbook was reorganized purely around these concepts.

### Takeaways
- Organizing a course around named primitives/models produces dramatically better learning outcomes.
- Assessment must be co-developed with the curriculum.
- Chemistry is the discipline most in need of this approach and least penetrated by it.

## 5. Adoption path is narrow but navigable

**ACS exams test content, not sequence.** A domain-primitive course covering the same content in different organization should be compatible. Non-majors courses face less coverage pressure.

**Three successful reform strategies:**
1. **Publisher parallelism** (atoms-first): Two-track offering eliminates ancillary barrier.
2. **Low trialability** (POGIL): Faculty can try one activity without overhauling their course.
3. **Institutional coalition** (Vision & Change): NSF/HHMI/AAAS backing lends legitimacy.

**OER is the strongest lever.** OpenStax reaches 72% of U.S. colleges, saved students $3.4B. OER eliminates publisher gatekeeping. Community colleges are natural early adopters.

### Takeaways
- Publish as OER first.
- Create explicit topic-mapping guides showing ACS exam coverage.
- Design standalone modules for "try before you buy."
- Seek NSF IUSE funding for proof-of-concept at 3-5 diverse institutions.

## 6. Non-majors forget almost everything — except frameworks

**No published longitudinal study tracks what non-science majors retain from chemistry 2-5 years later.** This is a remarkable gap.

Adjacent evidence:
- Medical students forget 25-35% within one year, >50% by year two (Custers, 2010).
- Conceptual understanding shows "only a few percent decline" at 6-18 months (Deslauriers & Wieman, 2011).
- MIT seniors scored 60% lower on analytic problem-solving from freshman physics but showed essentially unchanged conceptual scores (Pawl et al., 2012).
- Bahrick's "permastore" research: what enters permanent memory is not items but general knowledge schemas.
- Impey (2010, 20-year study): College gen-ed science courses "largely ineffectual in improving science literacy much beyond high school level."

### Takeaways
- For non-majors, optimize for reasoning frameworks, not factual retention.
- Named, practiced, repeatedly applied reasoning primitives are the closest analog to "schemas" that enter permastore.
- Assessment should measure whether students can _deploy_ a primitive in an unfamiliar context, not recall facts.
- The bar for improvement over current practice is low.

## The Verdict

**For:** Convergent evidence from Modeling Instruction, CLUE, Chemical Thinking, cognitive science, and retention research all point toward domain-primitive architecture. The non-majors market is uniquely suited (low exam pressure, stale incumbents, framework-retention advantage). No competitor exists. OER infrastructure is ready.

**Against:** No direct evidence for non-majors specifically. Assessment co-development is essential and expensive. Faculty adoption requires more than a good textbook. The approach requires rethinking the entire course (not droppable into existing syllabi). The naming problem is real — "domain-primitive" is engineering jargon, not pedagogy language.

**Bottom line:** Attempt it. Build on CLUE's four core ideas and Talanquer's reasoning dimensions. Adapt for non-majors who need literacy, not mastery. Publish as OER. Pilot at 3-5 institutions. Measure retention at 6 months and 2 years. Let the data settle what theory cannot.
